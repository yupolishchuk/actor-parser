He began his feature film career in 1963, playing the romantic lead in Tammy and the Doctor and joined the ensemble cast of the World War II saga The Victors. Shortly thereafter, Fonda began what would become a famous association with Roger Corman, starring in Wild Angels, as the ultra-cool, iron-fisted leader of a violent biker gang, opposite Nancy Sinatra, Bruce Dern, and Diane Ladd.

He is the son of Patricia Taylor, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu\'s father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu\'s mother is originally from England. After his parents\' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Youngblood (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics\' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, River\'s Edge (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Небезпечнi зв\'язки (1988) with director Stephen Frears.His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude \"Ted Logan\" in Неймовiрнi пригоди Бiлла i Теда (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves\'s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard\'s comedy, Батьки (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan\'s I Love You to Death (1990).Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix\'s narcoleptic male hustler in My Own Private Idaho (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire\'s lair in Дракула (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Багато галасу з нiчого (1993).In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Швидкiсть (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Feeling Minnesota (1996) and The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), and big films like A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and Адвокат диявола (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) and Ланцюгова реакцiя (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings\' cyberadventure, Матриця (1999).Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them The Replacements (2000), The Watcher (2000), The Gift (2000), Солодкий листопад (2001), and Hard Ball (2001) - before Матриця: Перезавантаження (2003) and Матриця: Революцiя (2003) were both released in 2003.Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Something\'s Gotta Give (2003), Будинок бiля озера (2006), and Королi вулиць (2008). He\'s kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Константин (2005), Затьмарення (2006), and День, коли Земля зупинилась (2008). And he\'s waded back into art-house territory with Ellie Parker (2005), Thumbsucker (2005), Приватне життя Пiппи Лi (2009), and Кримiнальна фiшка вiд Генрi (2010).Most recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Ронiн (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Плiч-о-плiч (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, Man of Tai Chi (2013).In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film Джон Вiк (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in Джон Уiк 2 (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.'),(11,'Carrie-Anne Moss','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMjgwNzEwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ0NzI5Ng@@._V1_UY317_CR12,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1967-08-21','Carrie-Anne Moss was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada. At age 20, after studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, she moved to Europe to pursue a career in modeling. While in Spain she was cast in a regular role in the TV show Dark Justice which was produced in Barcelona for its first season. She followed the series to its new shooting location in Los Angeles the next year. Once in LA she began getting more opportunities, one of which was a TV series Matrix (which coincidentally presaged the movie that would later make her famous), another was being cast as a series regular for Aaron Spelling\'s television spectacle Models Inc.Carrie-Anne\'s work was already gaining traction throughout the motion picture casting community when the late great casting director Mali Finn invited Carrie-Anne to audition for The Wachowski\'s and their top secret sci-fi action project; that activated her explosive film career. The writer/directors recognized Carrie-Anne\'s empowered yet openhearted leading qualities and following a challenging process of physical and character screen tests they ultimately gave her the opportunity to create the iconic cyber warrior \"Trinity\" in the record breaking, award winning and internationally successful The Matrix trilogy for Warner Bros/Village Roadshow. Her extraordinary performance launched her on to the world stage alongside her \"One\" Keanu Reeves, in stride with Laurence Fishburne and the multifaceted Hugo Weaving. Carrie-Anne Moss galvanized her place in cinematic history as the first woman to triumphantly fight her way through one of the highest grossing sci-fi action franchises of all time.Directly following her phenomenal new-found success Carrie-Anne received a wide range of scripts from studios and A-list filmmakers but it was the complex screenplay Memento that stirred her creative senses. After meeting the then unknown writer/director Christopher Nolan it was without hesitation that she accepted the role of \"Natalie\" in Nolan\'s directorial debut. Starring opposite the unforgettable Guy Pearce, and produced by Jennifer & Suzanne Todd, Memento became one of the most critically acclaimed and, at that time, the largest grossing independent film in history. Carrie-Anne Moss\'s remarkable performance won her the coveted Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female that year.Many of Hollywood\'s prominent directors and producers continued to pursue her for films; she survived the Red Planet for Warner Bros; sweetened Lasse Hallström\'s multi Oscar nominated Chocolat with Juliette Binoche, Dame Judi Dench and Johnny Depp; and tracked Suspect Zero alongside Aaron Eckhart and the elusive Sir Ben Kingsley in the Cruise/Wagner produced film.But it was over the next years that Carrie-Anne took on the most important and rewarding role of her life, becoming a mother to her three children. During that same time Carrie-Anne also mothered on screen the watchful Shia LaBeouf in the rear window-esque DreamWorks box-office hit Disturbia; and together with Samuel L. Jackson, led the intense terrorist interrogation of Michael Sheen in Sony\'s Unthinkable.Carrie-Anne continued to accept many other lead roles on interesting film projects including The Chumscrubber with Ralph Fiennes and Glenn Close; the comedy noir Mini\'s First Time also starring Alec Baldwin and Luke Wilson; Snow Cake the touching drama with Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman; Fireflies in the Garden in the company of Ryan Reynolds, Julia Roberts and Willem Defoe; and the retro zombie rom-com Fido along with Billy Connelly and Dylan Baker. It is Carrie-Anne\'s inclination towards thought-provoking filmmakers that has inspired her to lend her success to many other indie projects including Normal, Silent Hill, Elephant Song, Pompeii, Brain on Fire, The Bye Bye Man and more...Throughout her career, Carrie-Anne has been attracted to compelling television projects as well, like Ryan Murphy\'s, before its time, one hour FOX pilot Pretty Handsome where she played the curious wife to a cross-dressing Joseph Fiennes while dealing with her society mother-in-law Blythe Danner; CBS\'s Vegas a sin city period piece playing Nevada\'s first woman District Attorney for James Mangold and Nicholas Pileggi, which also starred the lawful Dennis Quaid and gaming Michael Chiklis; and a guest starring arc throughout the second season of AMC\'s Humans, experimenting as a highly regarded scientist with a deeply personal agenda, working alongside Gemma Chan.Carrie-Anne Moss has recently completed her third and final season as the powerful and enduring attorney \"Jerry Hogarth\" navigating her way through the Marvel universe in Jessica Jones for Netflix opposite Krysten Ritter and for show runner Melissa Rosenberg. In between seasons she tucked into the first bi-lingual English/Norwegian detective crime series Wisting, as an FBI agent that is following the leads to catch a serial killer in the Norwegian landscape. Adapted from the popular William Wisting detective series by novelist Jørn Lier Horst, Wisting international sales are being handled by distributor Cinenord.Marvel\'s Jessica Jones season three is expected to launch on Netflix in the spring of 2019.--March 2019--'),(12,'Brad Pitt','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MjE2MTQ2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE5MDY0Nw@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1963-12-18','An actor and producer known as much for his versatility as he is for his handsome face, Golden Globe-winner Brad Pitt\'s most widely recognized role may be Tyler Durden in Бiйцiвський клуб (1999). However, his portrayals of Billy Beane in Людина, яка змiнила все (2011), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Одинадцять друзiв Оушена (2001) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography.Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for \"el Pollo Loco\".Pitt\'s earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Тельма i Луiiза (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Cool World (1992).But Pitt\'s career hit an upswing with his casting in Там, де тече рiка (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt\'s subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in Справжнe кохання (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Iнтерв\'ю з вампiром: хронiка життя вампiра (1994) and Легенди осенi (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Сiм (1995).

She was offered representation by all the agents that she met. Within three months of being in Hollywood, Millie was cast as young Alice in ABC\'s fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time in Wonderland (2013), a spin-off of Once Upon a Time (2011).In November 2013, after just one self-taped audition, and without meeting the producers/directors, Millie was offered the role of Madison O\'Donnell in BBC America paranormal drama-thriller series Intruders (2014).

She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado, and has English, as well as smaller amounts of Danish, Swiss-German, and Norwegian, ancestry.Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder\'s Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as \"Brigadoon\" and \"A Chorus Line\". It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theatre work.Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in Вбивча краса (1999), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, Kirstie Alley encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, Жорстокi iгри (1999), in the part played in the film by Sarah Michelle Gellar, \"Kathryn Merteuil\". Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video Жорстокi iгри 2 (2000). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in Впiймай мене, якщо зможеш (2002), playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio.

The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of \"Giselle\" in the animated/live-action feature film, Зачарована (2007), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.Adams next appeared in the major production, Вiйна Чарлi Вiлсона (2007), and went on to act in the independent film, Чищення до блиску (2008), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.

DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as Ромео + Джульeта (1996) and Титанiк (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (née Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather\'s first name. Leonardo\'s father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late \'Harvey Pekar\', a friend of George\'s. Leonardo\'s performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and The New Lassie (1989), but it wasn\'t until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3 (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio\'s acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Growing Pains (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio\'s stint on Growing Pains (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public\'s attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in Що гнiтить Гiлберта Грейпа (1993), a young gunslinger in The Quick and the Dead (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in The Basketball Diaries (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo\'s reputation as an actor, it wasn\'t until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann\'s Ромео + Джульeта (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Титанiк (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Титанiк (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio\'s reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Титанiк (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in Людина в залiзнiй масцi (1998) and the low-budget Пляж (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Впiймай мене, якщо зможеш (2002) and Банди Нью-Йорка (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as Вiдступники (2006), Острiв проклятих (2010) and Christopher Nolan\'s Початок (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors.In 2012, he played a mustache-twirling villain in Джанго вiльний (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in Великий Гетсбi (2013) and Jordan Belfort in Вовк з Уолл-стрiт (2013).DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.'),(21,'Sharon Tate','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5MTIyODU5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQwODI2._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Sharon\'s early life was one of constant moving as her father served in the military.

His portrayal is genuine, and at no moment does it feel melodramatic and forced. The majority of his scenes are separate from the lead actors and for the most part it feels like The Impossible is Holland\'s film\" (Entertainment Maven); \"Mr. Holland, meanwhile, matures before our eyes, navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility.

The best I\'d ever seen in a kid.\" Ewan McGregor: \"It was wonderful watching Tom who had never worked in front of a camera before, to see him really get it and grow as a film actor as he went along. He\'s really talented and polite to everyone. It\'s very easy for children to lose perspective but he\'s absolutely on the right road and a brilliant actor.\" Naomi Watts: \"He has an incredible emotional instrument and an unbelievable sense of himself... Tom Holland and I had a couple of moments where we came together and I could just tell how wonderful he was and what a beautiful instrument he had. It was just easy to work with him, that was one of the greatest highlights for me: discovering a friendship with Tom off-screen and this beautiful relationship between mother and son on-screen. The intimacy that develops through the course of the film between Lucas and Maria, I just loved that relationship. I mean, Tom is a beyond gifted actor. He\'s just a raw, open talent that is just so easy to work with. And Tom, he\'s inspiring, he kind of lifts everyone\'s game around him because he can do nothing but tell the truth. He was great.\"In his turn, Tom Holland has returned favours to Naomi Watts when he was asked to present Desert Palm Achievement Award to her at Palm Springs International Film Festival. According to HitFix: \"One recurring theme of the night was how the introductions were often better than actual winner\'s speeches... The best intro, however, had to go to 16-year-old Tom Holland who intro\'d his \"Impossible\" co-star Watts. Holland admitted of all of Watts\' great performances his dad had only let him see \"King Kong\" and while they spent six weeks shooting in a water tank he didn\'t know it was \"difficult\" because he actually \"loved it\"...

She was also able to work as a photo model. However, an injured knee put a halt to her dancing career.In 1994, her mother bought her a one-way ticket to Los Angeles, and Charlize started visiting all of the agents on Hollywood Boulevard, but without any luck.

She made a scene and an agent gave her his card, in exchange for learning American English, which she did by watching soap operas on television.Her first role was in the B-film Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest (1995), a non-speaking part with three seconds of screen time.

His family is of Irish origin. Gerard spent some of his very early childhood in Montreal, Quebec, but was mostly raised, along with his older brother and sister, in his hometown of Paisley. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised primarily by their mother, who later remarried. He had no contact with his father between the ages of two and 16 years old, after which time they became close. His father passed away when Gerard was in his early 20s. Butler went on to attend Glasgow University, where he studied to be a lawyer/solicitor. He was president of the school\'s law society thanks to his outgoing personality and great social skills.His acting career began when he was approached in a London coffee shop by actor Steven Berkoff, who later appeared alongside Butler in Attila (2001), who gave him a role in a stage production of \"Coriolanus\". After that, Butler decided to give up law for acting. He was cast as Ewan McGregor\'s character \"Renton\" in the stage adaptation of Trainspotting. His film debut was as Billy Connolly\'s younger brother in Mrs Brown (1997). While filming the movie in Scotland, he was enjoying a picnic with his mother near the River Tay when they heard the shouts of a young boy, who had been swimming with a friend, who was in some trouble. Butler jumped in and saved the young boy from drowning. He received a Certificate of Bravery from the Royal Humane Society. He felt he only did what anyone in the situation would have done.His film career continued with small roles, first in the \"James Bond\" movie, 007: Завтра не помре нiколи (1997), and then Russell Mulcahy\'s Tale of the Mummy (1998). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being \"Attila the Hun\" in the USA Network mini-series, Attila (2001). The film\'s producers wanted a known actor to play the part but kept coming back to Butler\'s screen tests and decided he was their man. He had to lose the thick Scottish accent, but managed well. Around the time \"Attila\" was being filmed, casting was in progress for Wes Craven\'s new take on the \"Dracula\" legacy. Also wanting a known name, Butler wasn\'t much of a consideration, but his unending tenacity drove him to hounding the producers. Eventually, he sent them a clip of his portrayal of \"Attila\". Evidently, they saw something because Dracula 2000 (2000) was cast in the form of Butler. Attila\'s producers, thinking that his big-screen role might help with their own film\'s ratings, finished shooting a little early so he could get to work on Dracula 2000 (2000). Following these two roles, Butler developed quite a fan base, an Internet site and began appearing on lists everywhere.Since then, he has appeared in Влада вогню (2002) as \"Creedy\" and Лара Крофт: Розкрадачка гробниць - Колиска життя (2003) as \"Terry Sheridan\", alongside Angelina Jolie.

Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague. Last year, he appeared in Andrew Lloyd Webber\'s musical, Привид опери (2004), playing the title character in the successful adaptation of the stage musical.

However, the versatile actor has been steadily working on both stage and screen since his television debut in the miniseries Брати по зброii (2001). After being cast in the World War II drama, Hardy left his studies at the prestigious Drama Centre in London and was subsequently cast as Twombly in Ridley Scott\'s Падiння чорного яструба (2001) and as the villain Shinzon in Зоряний шлях: Вiдплата (2002).Edward Thomas Hardy was born on September 15, 1977 in Hammersmith, London; his mother, Elizabeth Anne (Barrett), is an artist and painter, and his father, Chips Hardy, is a writer. He is of English and Irish descent. Hardy was brought up in East Sheen, London, and first studied at Reed\'s School. His education continued at Tower House School, then at Richmond Drama School, and subsequently at the Drama Centre London, along with fellow Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender. After winning a modeling competition at age 21, he had a brief contract with the agency Models One.Tom spent his teens and early twenties battling delinquency, alcoholism and drug addiction; after completing his work on Зоряний шлях: Вiдплата (2002), he sought treatment and has also admitted that his battles with addiction ended his five-year marriage to Sarah Ward. Returning to work in 2003, Hardy was awarded the Evening Standard Most Promising Newcomer Award for his theatre performances in the productions of \"In Arabia, We\'d All Be Kings\" and \"Blood\". In 2003, Tom also co-starred in the play \"The Modernists\" with Paul Popplewell, Jesse Spencer and Orlando Wells.During the next five years, Hardy worked consistently in film, television and theatre, playing roles as varied as Robert Dudley in the BBC\'s The Virgin Queen (2005), Bill Sikes in Олiвер Твiст (2007) and starring in \"The Man of Mode\" at the National Theatre. On the silver screen, he appeared in the crime thriller Листковий пирiг (2004) with Daniel Craig, Sofia Coppola\'s Марiя-Антуанетта (2006), and the romp Scenes of a Sexual Nature (2006).In 2006, Hardy created \"Shotgun\", an underground theatre company along with director Robert Delamere, and directed a play, penned by his father for the company, called \"Blue on Blue\". In 2007, Hardy received a best actor BAFTA nomination for his touching performance as Stuart Shorter in the BBC adaptation of Alexander Masters\' bestselling biography Stuart: A Life Backwards (2007). Hailed for his transformative character acting, Hardy was lauded for his emotionally and physically convincing portrayal in the ill-fated and warmhearted tale of Shorter, a homeless and occasionally violent man suffering from addiction and muscular dystrophy.The following year, he appeared as gay hoodlum Handsome Bob in the Guy Ritchie film Рок-н-рольщик (2008), but this would be his next transformation that would prove his extensive range and stun critics. In the film Бронсон (2008), Hardy played the notorious Charles Bronson (given name, Michael Peterson), the \"most violent prisoner in Britain\". Bald, pumped-up, and outfitted with Bronson\'s signature strongman mustache, Hardy is unrecognizable and gives a harrowing performance that is physically fearless and psychologically unsettling. Director Nicolas Winding Refn breaks the fourth wall with Hardy retelling his tales directly to viewers as well as performing them outright before an audience of his own imagining. The performance mixes terrifying brutality, vaudevillian showmanship, wry humor, and an alarming amount of commitment, and won Hardy a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor. The performance got Hollywood\'s attention, and in 2009, Hardy was named one of Variety\'s \"10 Actors to Watch\". That year, he continued to garner praise for his starring role in The Take (2009), a four-part adaptation of Martina Cole\'s bestselling crime novel, as well as for his performance as Heathcliff in a version of Wuthering Heights (2009).Recent work includes the aforementioned breakthrough appearance in Початок (2010) alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard and Ellen Page.

Tom also starred in the heralded Cold War thriller, Шпигуне, вийди геть! (2011) with Colin Firth and Gary Oldman. Hardy rejoined Christopher Nolan for Темний лицар повертаеться (2012); he played the villain role of Bane opposite Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gary Oldman. Hardy\'s menacing physique and his character\'s scrambled, hard-to-distinguish voice became a major discussion point as the film was released.Outside of performing, Hardy is the patron for the charity \"Flack\", which is an organization to aid the recovery of the homeless in Cambridge. And in 2010, Hardy was named an Ambassador for The Prince\'s Trust, which helps disadvantaged youth. On the recent stage, he starred in the Brett C. Leonard play \"The Long Red Road\" in early 2010. Written for Hardy and directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the play was staged at Chicago\'s Goodman Theater.In 2015, Hardy starred as the iconic Mad Max in George Miller\'s reboot of his franchise, Шалений Макс: Дорога гнiву (2015).

She was born in Readington Township, New Jersey, USA, to Ukrainian-born parents Michael and Lubomyra (Spas) Farmiga.Unlike her older sister, Taissa initially had no interest in becoming an actor. However, she was persuaded to make her acting debut in Vera\'s directorial debut film Higher Ground (2011). Also playing the lead, Vera wanted to cast someone who was physically similar to play the younger version of her character. Taissa was 15 years old and, apart from a second grade school play, had no previous acting experience. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and Taissa\'s performance received critical acclaim. It was after Sundance that Taissa officially decided to pursue acting.

His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother\'s heritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German. The young Stallone attended the American College of Switzerland and the University of Miami, eventually obtaining a B.A. degree. Initially, he struggled in small parts in films such as the soft-core The Party at Kitty and Stud\'s (1970), the thriller Klute (1971) and the comedy Bananas (1971). He got a crucial career break alongside fellow young actor Henry Winkler, sharing lead billing in the effectively written teen gang film The Lords of Flatbush (1974). Further film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring productions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac, bloodthirsty race driver named \"Machine Gun Joe Viterbo\" in the Roger Corman-produced Смертельнi перегони 2000-го року (1975). However, Stallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an actor, and, inspired by the 1975 Muhammad Ali-Chuck Wepner fight in Cleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given the \"million to one opportunity\" to challenge for the heavyweight title. Роккi (1976) became the stuff of cinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially successful movie franchises in history! Whilst full credit is wholly deserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from fellow cast members Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young, and director John G. Avildsen gave the film an emotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived on his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure Hollywood\'s hottest new star.Stallone followed Роккi (1976) with F.I.S.T (1978), loosely based on the life of Teamsters boss \"Jimmy Hoffa\", and Paradise Alley (1978) before pulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the sequel Роккi II (1979). The second outing for the \"Italian Stallion\" wasn\'t as powerful or successful as the first \"Rocky\"; however, it still produced strong box office. Subsequent films Нiчнi яструби (1981) and Victory (1981) failed to ignite with audiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory with Роккi III (1982) and a fearsome opponent in \"Clubber Lang\" played by muscular ex-bodyguard Mr. T. The third \"Rocky\" installment far outperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone retired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another mega-franchise was about to commence for the busy actor.The character of Green Beret \"John Rambo\" was the creation of Canadian-born writer David Morrell, and his novel was adapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in Рембо: Перша кров (1982), also starring Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy. The movie was a surprise hit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the Vietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public\'s psyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and a sequel soon followed with Рембо: Перша кров. Частина друга (1985), which drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the film\'s plotline about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam. But they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and \"John Rambo\'s\" second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and cemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave of amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky Balboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a Soviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named \"Ivan Drago\" played by curt Dolph Lundgren in Роккi IV (1985). The fourth outing was somewhat controversial with \"Rocky\" fans, as violence levels seemed excessive compared to previous \"Rocky\" films, especially with the savage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, at the hands of the unstoppable \"Siberian Express\".Stallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films that met with a mixed reception from his fans. Cobra (1986) was a clumsy mess, Over the Top (1987) was equally mediocre, Рембо III (1988) saw Rambo take on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film Танго i Кеш (1989) just did not quite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there was chemistry between Stallone and co-star Kurt Russell.Philadelphia\'s favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his fifth screen outing in Роккi V (1990) tackling Tommy \"Machine\" Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter Tommy Morrison, the great-nephew of screen legend John Wayne. Sly quickly followed with the lukewarm comedy Оскар (1991), the painfully unfunny Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992), the futuristic action film Руйнiвник (1993), and the comic book-inspired Суддя Дредд (1995). Interestingly, Stallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he had been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more dramatically challenging role in the intriguing Cop Land (1997), also starring Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. It isn\'t a classic of the genre, but Cop Land (1997) certainly surprised many critics with Stallone\'s understated performance. Stallone then lent his vocal talents to the animated adventure story Мураха Антц (1998), reprised the role made famous by Michael Caine in a terrible remake of Get Carter (2000), climbed back into a race car for Гонщик (2001), and guest-starred as the \"Toymaker\" in the third chapter of the immensely popular \"Spy Kids\" film series, Дiти шпигунiв 3D: Кiнець гри (2003). Showing that age had not wearied his two most popular franchises, Stallone has most recently brought back never-say-die boxer Rocky Balboa to star in, well, what else but Роккi Бальбоа (2006), and Vietnam veteran Рембо IV (2008) will reappear after a 20-year hiatus to once again right wrongs in the jungles of Thailand.Love him or loathe him, Sylvester Stallone has built an enviable and highly respected career in Hollywood; plus, he has considerably influenced modern popular culture through several of his iconic film characters.'),(53,'Tessa Thompson','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk4MDU3NDg4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMxMjcwNA@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1983-10-03','The actress Tessa Lynn Thompson was born on October 3, 1983 in Los Angeles, California.

He had a comfortable, middle-class upbringing in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. Eastwood\'s parents relocated to Washington state in 1949, and Clint worked menial jobs in the Pacific Northwest until returning to California for a stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation. He enrolled at Los Angeles City College, but dropped out after two semesters to pursue acting. During the mid-\'50s he found uncredited bit parts in such B-films as Revenge of the Creature (1955) and Tarantula (1955) while simultaneously digging swimming pools to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Rawhide (1959) with Eric Fleming. Though only a secondary player for the first seven seasons, Clint was promoted to series star when Fleming departed in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.Eastwood\'s big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone\'s trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: За жменю доларiв (1964), На декiлька доларiв бiльше (1965), and Хороший, поганий, злий (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice for Clint\'s character, finally getting American distribution in 1967. As the last film racked up phenomenal grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from undistinguished TV actor to sought-after box office attraction in just a matter of months. Yet again a success was the late-blooming star\'s first U.S.-made western, Hang \'Em High (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in Coogan\'s Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series McCloud (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Куди залiтають тiльки орли (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Paint Your Wagon (1969). In Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970) and Kelly\'s Heroes (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a predatory Union soldier in The Beguiled (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Play Misty for Me (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in Брудний Гаррi (1971), meanwhile, gave him cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Thereafter, Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies: the westerns Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels Magnum Force (1973) and The Enforcer (1976), the road adventures Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) and The Gauntlet (1977), and the fact-based prison film Втеча з Алькатрасу (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Every Which Way but Loose (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, The Eiger Sanction (1975) notwithstanding, the \'70s were an uninterrupted success for Clint.Eastwood kicked off the \'80s with Any Which Way You Can (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Sudden Impact (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase, \"Make my day.\" Clint also starred in Bronco Billy (1980), Firefox (1982), Tightrope (1984), City Heat (1984), Pale Rider (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988 he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs Pink Cadillac (1989) and Новачок (1990), it seemed Eastwood\'s star was declining as it never had before. He started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston. (Both films had a limited release.)Eastwood bounced back with his dark western Непрощенний (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in In the Line of Fire (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received Iдеальний свiт (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next up was a love story, Мости округу Медiсон (1995), where Clint surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Absolute Power (1997) and Космiчнi ковбоii (2000) did well enough, while Справжнiй злочин (1999) and Blood Work (2002) were received badly, as was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), which he directed but didn\'t appear in.Eastwood surprised yet again in 2005, when he returned to the top of the A-list with Крихiтка на мiльйон доларiв (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Clint. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. Eastwood\'s next starring vehicle, Гран Торiно (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Trouble with the Curve (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012). Between screen appearances, Clint chalked up an impressive list of additional credits behind the camera. He directed Таeмнича рiчка (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), Прапори наших батькiв (2006), Листи з Iводзiми (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), Пiдмiна (2008) (a vehicle for screen megastar Angelina Jolie), Непiдкорений (2009) (again with Freeman), Hereafter (2010), Дж. Едгар (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), Американський снайпер (2014) (2014\'s top box office champ), Саллi (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and The 15:17 to Paris (2018) (based on the thwarted Thalys train attack of 2015). His latest project, in which he stars as an unlikely drug courier, is Наркокур\'eр (2018).Eastwood\'s individuality outside of work has been extremely convoluted, to put it mildly. He managed to keep his personal life top secret for the first three decades of his celebrity. (To this day the Hollywood kingpin refuses to disclose exactly how many families he\'s started.) He had a long time relationship with frequent \'70s/\'80s co-star Locke, who published a scathing memoir in 1997, and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women. He has only been married twice, however -- with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.

Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry.

He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a Priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in Endless Love (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.With handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top grossing films of the 1980s including Кращий стрiлець (1986); Колiр грошей (1986), Людина дощу (1988) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989).

Her next role after that was an episode of the British horror anthology TV series Tales of the Unexpected (1979) in 1984.After Leone\'s movie, horror master Dario Argento signed her to play her first starring role in his thriller Phenomena (1985). The film made a lot of money in Europe but, unfortunately, was heavily cut for American distribution. Around the same time, she appeared in the rock video \"I Drove All Night,\" a Roy Orbison song, co-starring Jason Priestley. She released a single called \"Monologue of Love\" in Japan in the mid-1980s, in which she sings in Japanese a charming little song with semi-classical instruments arrangement. On the B-side is \"Message Of Love,\" which is an interview with music in background. She also appeared in television commercials in Japan.She enrolled at Yale, and then transferred two years later to Stanford. She trained in classical theater and improvisation, studying with the late drama coach Roy London, Howard Fine, and Harold Guskin.The late 1980s saw her starring in a hit and three lesser seen films. Amongst the latter was her roles in Etoile (1989), as a ballerina and in Some Girls (1988), where she played a self-absorbed college freshman. The hit was Лабiринт (1986), released in 1986. Jennifer got the job after a nationwide talent search for the lead in this fantasy directed by Jim Henson and produced by George Lucas. Her career entered in a calm phase after those films, until Dennis Hopper, who was impressed after having seen her in \"Some Girls\", cast Jennifer as an ingénue small-town girl in The Hot Spot (1990), based upon the 1950s crime novel \"Hell Hath No Fury\". It received mixed critical reviews, but it was not a box office success.The Rocketeer (1991), an ambitious Touchstone super-production, came to the rescue. The film was an old-fashioned adventure flick about a man capable of flying with rockets on his back. Critics saw in \"Rocketeer\" a top-quality movie, a homage to those old films of the 1930s in which the likes of Errol Flynn starred. After \"Rocketeer,\" Jennifer made Career Opportunities (1991), The Heart of Justice (1992), Mulholland Falls (1996), her first collaboration with Nick Nolte and Inventing the Abbotts (1997). In 1998, she was invited by director Alex Proyas to make Темне мiсто (1998), a strange, visually stunning science-fiction extravaganza. In this movie, Jennifer played the main character\'s wife, and she delivered an acclaimed performance. The film itself didn\'t break any box-office record but received positive reviews. This led Jennifer to a contract with Fox for the television series The $treet (2000), a main part in the memorable and dramatic love-story Waking the Dead (2000) and, more important, a breakthrough part in the polemic and applauded independent Реквieм за мрieю (2000), a tale about the haunting lives of drug addicts and the subsequent process of decadence and destruction. In \"Requiem for a Dream,\" Jennifer had her career\'s most courageous, difficult part, a performance that earned her a Spirit Award Nomination. She followed this role with Pollock (2000), in which she played Pollock\'s mistress, Ruth Klingman. In 2001, Ron Howard chose her to co-star with Russell Crowe in Iгри розуму (2001), the film that tells the true story of John Nash, a man who suffered from mental illness but eventually beats this and wins the Nobel Prize in 1994. Jennifer played Nash\'s wife and won a Golden Globe, BAFTA, AFI and Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. Connelly continued her career with films including Халк (2003), her second collaboration with Nick Nolte, Dark Water (2005), Кривавий дiамант (2006), День, коли Земля зупинилась (2008), Обiцяти - ще не одружитись (2009) and Ной (2014), where she did her second collaboration with both Darren Aronofsky and Russell Crowe and made her third collaboration with Nick Nolte in that same film.Jennifer lives in New York. She is 5\'7\", and speaks fluent Italian and French. She enjoys physical activities such as swimming, gymnastics, and bike riding. She is also an outdoors person -- camping, hiking and walking, and is interested in quantum physics and philosophy. She likes horses, Pearl Jam, SoundGarden, Jesus Jones, and occasionally wears a small picture of the The Dalai Lama on a necklace. Her favorite colors are cobalt blue, forest green, and \"very pale green/gray -- sort of like the color of the sea\".

She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole\'s father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents\' native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole\'s first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member Jane Campion (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite Bush Christmas (1983). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in BMX Bandits (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries Vietnam (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite Sam Neill in the at-sea thriller Dead Calm (1989).Kidman\'s next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as Tom Cruise\'s doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance Днi грому (1990), she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film Flirting (1991), then as Dustin Hoffman\'s moll in the gangster flick Billy Bathgate (1991). She reunited with Cruise for Далеко-далеко (1992), the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite Michael Keaton in the tear-tugger My Life (1993). Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), but achieved her real breakthrough with Gus Van Sant\'s Померти заради (1995). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics\' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, Jane Campion, on the adaptation of Henry James\'s The Portrait of a Lady (1996). A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in The Peacemaker (1997), adding \"action star\" to her professional repertoire.She and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for Stanley Kubrick\'s sexual thriller Iз широко заплющеними очима (1999). The couple\'s on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise\'s homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, Antonia Kidman, discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents\' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001.'),(70,'Ana de Armas','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NjYzMzE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA4NDY4OTE@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1988-04-30','Ana de Armas was born in Cuba on April 30, 1988.

The audition was with the same casting director who was casting the titular role in the reboot of Конан-варвар (2011). Four weeks after being cast as the popular Robert E.

His approach, like that of the filmmakers, was to pull from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Jason has a production company, Pride of Gypsies, in which he is expanding his career from actor to filmmaker.

Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter\'s Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client.

He then appeared in his first major feature, Not Another Teen Movie (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.After filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - Just Married (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, The Perfect Score (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, Стiльниковий (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman\'s life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, Стiльниковий (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in Фантастична четвiрка (2005), 20th Century Fox\'s long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance.

Though widely reported, it is untrue that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); he never applied to college because he \"wanted to rap.\" Smith says he was admitted to a \"pre-engineering [summer] program\" at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend. According to Smith, \"My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT.

Smith\'s first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence.In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich\'s Independence Day. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw.

In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.He turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves\'s performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he \"made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better.\"In 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.He has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It Takes a Thief.On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman\'s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard.

He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named \'The Kids\'. However, it was when he married Lori Anne Allison (Lori A. Depp) that he took up the job of being a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp\'s film debut in the low-budget horror film, Жах на вулицi В\'язiв (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street (1987).In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Едвард Руки-ножицi (1990). Following the film\'s success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of Ед Вуд (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film Доннi Браско (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in Страх i огида в Лас-Вегасi (1998), directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film Дружина астронавта (1999).

Over the course of 15 years of filmmaking, Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made.At 7 years old, Nolan began making short movies with his father\'s Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimetre films at U.C.L.\'s film society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature, Переслiдування (1998), on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its theatrical release, and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his next film.Nolan\'s second film was Пам\'ятай (2000), which he directed from his own screenplay based on a short story by his brother Jonathan. Starring Guy Pearce, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological thriller, Безсоння (2002), starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.The turning point in Nolan\'s career occurred when he was awarded the chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Бетмен: Початок (2005), Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero, and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller Престиж (2006), starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced Темний лицар (2008) which went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the worldwide box office.

Award, and the film also received eight Academy Award nominations.In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the sci-fi thriller Початок (2010), which he directed and produced from his own original screenplay. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster, earning more than $800,000,000 dollars and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films of the year. Among its many honors, Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with D.G.A. and P.G.A.

He moved around a great deal after his parents\' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.Ron Howard was working on Сплеск (1984), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character\'s wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet (1987), Hanks\' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Великий (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in Iiхня власна лiга (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with Несплячi в Сiетлi (1993) and then with Фiладельфiя (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks\' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia\'s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Форрест Гамп (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.Hanks\' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Аполлон 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar\'s computer-animated film Iсторiя iграшок (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody.

Her grandfather was Major General Peter Blunt, and her uncle is MP Crispin Blunt. Emily received a rigorous education at Ibstock Place School, a co-ed private school at Roehampton. However, young Emily Blunt had a stammer, since she was a kid of 8. Her mother took her to relaxation classes, which did not do anything.

For most of his formative years, his father was an acclaimed actor in Europe but had not yet achieved the international fame that came after his star turn in Розсiкаючи хвилi (1996). Young Alexander was raised under modest circumstances in a working-class Swedish neighborhood as his parents wanted their children to have as normal an upbringing as possible. He began his acting career at the age of eight and continued working in films and on Swedish television until he turned sixteen and decided acting was not the career for him. Life under a microscope lost its charm and perhaps due to the influence of My Skarsgård, his physician mother, he stopped working as an actor, to continue his education.Instead of continuing college, at the age of nineteen, he entered compulsory military service (military conscription). He used the time to contemplate his future. He studied at the Leeds Metropolitan University then moved to New York where he enrolled at Marymount Manhattan College to study theatre.

Thanks to the writer\'s strike, after completing Generation Kill (2008), he was cast in the role of \"Eric Northman\", a 1,000-year-old Viking vampire on the hit series, True Blood (2008). The series was created by Alan Ball, the man behind Six Feet Under (2001). True Blood (2008) was adapted from the \"Sookie Stackhouse\' novels by Charlaine Harris\' and rode to success on quality scripts, great acting and the public\'s obsession with the vampire genre. In addition to True Blood (2008), which begins its third season in 2010, Alexander has a number of film projects in the works including the remake of Straw Dogs (2011), Меланхолiя (2011), written and directed by Lars von Trier, action Sci-Fi film, Морський бiй (2012), and The East (2013), directed by Zal Batmanglij.'),(141,'Timothy Olyphant','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NzY0OTA2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDYzODgz._V1_UY317_CR4,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1968-05-20','From Timothy Olyphant\'s first screen appearances, such as his two-minute bit in The First Wives Club (1996), to \"Nicko\", whose presence at times dwarfed the island in A Perfect Getaway (2009), he has been a force to be reckoned with.Born in Hawaii, Timothy David Olyphant was raised in Modesto, California. He is the son of Katherine Lyon (Gideon) and John Vernon Bevan Olyphant, a college teacher who was also an executive at E & J Gallo Winery. He has an older brother, Andy, who is in A&R for Warner Bros. Records, and a younger brother, Matt Olyphant, who was the lead singer for the punk rock group, Fetish, and is also an artist. He is a descendant of the prominent Vanderbilt and Olyphant families of businesspeople, and his ancestry includes Russian Jewish (from a maternal great-grandfather), English, German, Scottish, Dutch, and Irish. Timothy quickly became Modesto\'s favorite son, competing as a pro swimmer and excelling at drawing. It was, by chance, that he enrolled in an acting course as an elective and decided to pursue an acting career. He took his family and headed to New York City, where he studied the craft and began auditioning for roles. From the beginning, he tried to choose diversified roles and take chances with every genre and always approached everything he did with commitment, humor and grace. Timothy is married to his college sweetheart, Alexis Knief, and, together, they raise three children, one son and two daughters in California. He has managed to keep his personal life out of the tabloids. He obviously has his priorities straight, as this is no easy task in Hollywood.Highlights of Olyphant\'s career include his riveting portrayal of \"Sheriff Seth Bullock\" in HBO\'s hit drama, Deadwood (2004). He now personifies intensity as complex Kentucky Marshal, \"Raylan Givens\", in FX\'s Justified (2010). On the big screen, in 2010\'s The Crazies (2010), he had the chance to infuse his character with doubts, fears and humaneness in an inhumane situation.

Robert was a scrappy kid who stole hubcaps in school and lost his college baseball scholarship at the University of Colorado because of drunkenness.After leaving UoC, he spent some time drifting across America, spending a time working in the California oil fields. Having saved enough he moved to Europe studying art in Paris and Florence.Back in the States he decided on a career as a theatrical designer in New York. Enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Art he turned to acting making his stage debut in \'Tall Story\'. In 1962 he was signed for the stage production of \'Barefoot in the Park\' which was a smash hit but it wasn\'t until 5 years later when it was filmed that he became an important star.Television and stage experience coupled with all-American good looks led to movies and television roles. His breakthrough role was \"The Sundance Kid\" in Бутч Кессiдi та Санденс Кiд (1969), when the actor was 33. Якими ми були (1973) and Аферисти (1973), both in 1973, made Redford the number one box office star for the next three years. Redford used his clout to advance environmental causes and his riches to acquire Utah property, which he transformed into a ranch and the Sundance ski resort. In 1980, he established the Sundance Institute for aspiring filmmakers. Its annual film festival has become one of the world\'s most influential. Redford\'s directorial debut, Звичайнi люди (1980), won him the Academy Award as Best Director in 1981. He waited eight years before getting behind the camera again, this time for the screen version of John Nichols\' acclaimed novel of the Southwest, The Milagro Beanfield War (1988).

Having made films in Poland, Britain, France and the USA, he is considered one of the few truly international filmmakers. Roman Polanski was born in Paris in 1933.His parents returned to Poland from France in 1936, three years before World War II began. On Germany\'s invasion in 1939, as a family of mostly Jewish heritage, they were all sent to the Krakow ghetto. His parents were then captured and sent to two different concentration camps: His father to Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria, where he survived the war, and his mother to Auschwitz where she was murdered. Roman witnessed his father\'s capture and then, at only 7, managed to escape the ghetto and survive the war, at first wandering through the Polish countryside and pretending to be a Roman-Catholic kid visiting his relatives. Although this saved his life, he was severely mistreated suffering nearly fatal beating which left him with a fractured skull.Local people usually ignored the cinemas where German films were shown, but Polanski seemed little concerned by the propaganda and often went to the movies. As the war progressed, Poland became increasingly war-torn and he lived his life as a tramp, hiding in barns and forests, eating whatever he could steal or find. Still under 12 years old, he encountered some Nazi soldiers who forced him to hold targets while they shot at them. At the war\'s end in 1945, he reunited with his father who sent him to a technical school, but young Polanski seemed to have already chosen another career. In the 1950s, he took up acting, appearing in Andrzej Wajda\'s Pokolenie (1955) before studying at the Lodz Film School. His early shorts such as Dwaj ludzie z szafa (1958), Le gros et le maigre (1961) and Ssaki (1962), showed his taste for black humor and interest in bizarre human relationships. His feature debut, Knife in the Water (1962), was one of the first Polish post-war films not associated with the war theme. It was also the first movie from Poland to get an Oscar nomination for best foreign film. Though already a major Polish filmmaker, Polanski chose to leave the country and headed to France. While down-and-out in Paris, he befriended young scriptwriter, Gérard Brach, who eventually became his long-time collaborator. The next two films, Вiдраза (1965) and Cul-de-sac (1966), made in England and co-written by Brach, won respectively Silver and then Golden Bear awards at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1968, Polanski went to Hollywood, where he made the psychological thriller, Дитина Розмарi (1968). However, after the brutal murder of his wife, Sharon Tate, by the Manson Family in 1969, the director decided to return to Europe. In 1974, he again made a US release - it was Китайський квартал (1974).It seemed the beginning of a promising Hollywood career, but after his conviction for the sodomy of a 13-year old girl, Polanski fled from he USA to avoid prison. After Tess (1979), which was awarded several Oscars and Cesars, his works in 1980s and 1990s became intermittent and rarely approached the caliber of his earlier films. It wasn\'t until Пiанiст (2002) that Polanski came back to full form. For that movie, he won nearly all the most important film awards, including the Oscar for Best Director, Cannes Film Festival\'s Palme d\'Or, the BAFTA and Cesar Award.He still likes to act in the films of other directors, sometimes with interesting results, as in Звичайна формальнiсть (1994).'),(146,'Eva Green','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDA2ODE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI0Nzc3Nw@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1980-07-06','French actress and model Eva Gaëlle Green was born on July 6, 1980, in Paris, France. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film Au hasard Balthazar (1966). Her mother, Marlène Jobert, is an actress turned children\'s book writer. Eva\'s mother was born in Algeria, of French, Spanish, and Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of France), and Eva\'s father is of Swedish, French, and Breton descent. She has a fraternal twin sister, Joy. Eva left French school at 17. She switched to the American School in France for one year. She left the American School and studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic Art in London. She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on stage in several theater productions: \"La Jalousie en Trois Fax\" and \"Turcaret\". There, she caught the eye of director Bernardo Bertolucci. Green followed a recommendation to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing Мрiйники (2003) with Bernardo Bertolucci. During their work, Bertolucci described Green as being \"so beautiful it\'s indecent\".Green won critical acclaim for her role in Мрiйники (2003). She also attracted a great deal of attention from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. After \"The Dreamers\", Green\'s career ascended to the level where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest of cult French gentleman stealer, Arsène Lupin (2004), opposite Romain Duris. In 2005, she co-starred, opposite Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson, in Царство небесне (2005), produced and directed by Ridley Scott. The film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale role in The Black Dahlia (2006), that went to Hilary Swank, because she didn\'t want to end up typecast as a femme fatale after her role in \"The Dreamers\". Instead, Eva accepted the prestigious role of \"Vesper Lynd\", one of three Bond girls, opposite Daniel Craig, in 007: Казино Рояль (2006) and became the 5th French actress to play a James Bond girl, after Claudine Auger in 007: Кульова блискавка (1965), Corinne Cléry in 007: Мiсячний гонщик (1979), Carole Bouquet in 007: Тiльки для ваших очей (1981) and Sophie Marceau in 007: I цiлого свiту замало (1999). She achieved international recognition for the film, one of the highest-grossing Bond movies ever.Since then, Green has starred in the films Похмурi тiнi (2012), 300 спартанцiв: Вiдродження iмперii (2014), Мiсто грiхiв 2: Жiнка, заради якоii варто вбивати (2014), and Miss Peregrine\'s Home for Peculiar Children (2016). She also starred as Vanessa Ives in Showtime\'s horror drama \"Penny Dreadful\" (2014)_. Her performance in the series earned her a nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series - Drama at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.Since her school years, Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she and her twin sister can\'t speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor.

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O\'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig is of English, as well as Welsh, Scottish, and Irish, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore\'s 007: Живи i дай померти (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre\'s (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare\'s \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Лара Крофт: Розкрадачка гробниць (2001) and Проклятий шлях (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Листковий пирiг (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Мюнхен (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig\'s reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964.

His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale\'s childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.His first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in \"The Nerd\". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986) caught Steven Spielberg\'s eye, leading to Bale\'s well-documented role in Iмперiя сонця (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.Adjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh\'s 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare\'s Генрiх V (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of Treasure Island (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Newsies (1992), Swing Kids (1993), Маленькi жiнки (1994), The Portrait of a Lady (1996), The Secret Agent (1996), Metroland (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and A Midsummer Night\'s Dream (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.Bale roared into the next decade with a lead role in Американський психопат (2000), director Mary Harron\'s adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for \"Entertainment Weekly\" crowned Bale one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures\" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\", and \"Premiere\" lauded him as one of the \"Hottest Leading Men Under 30\".Bale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft (2000), Captain Corelli\'s Mandolin (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon (2002), and Влада вогню (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.Two more cult films followed: Еквiлiбрiум (2002) and Машинiст (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale\'s physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.Bale\'s abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Бетмен: Початок (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan\'s definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Бетмен i Робiн (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.Bale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman\'s phenomenal success: The New World (2005) and Harsh Times (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006\'s Rescue Dawn (2006), Werner Herzog\'s feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in Престиж (2006), the remake of Потяг до Юми (2007), and a reunion with director Todd Haynes in the experimental Bob Dylan biography, Мене там немаe. (2007).Anticipation for Темний лицар (2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of Heath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale\'s graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.Bale\'s next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less Термiнатор: Спасiння прийде (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann\'s Джоннi Д. (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.For all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of Боeць (2010)\'s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.Bale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic Квiти вiйни (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.Bale capped his role is Bruce Wayne/Batman in Темний лицар повертаеться (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Out of the Furnace (2013) with Шалене серце (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy Американська афера (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell.Bale will re-team with The New World (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Лицар кубкiв (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama.In his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation.

After a tumultuous yet happy childhood with his four younger siblings, Renner graduated from Beyer High School and attended Modesto Junior College. He explored several areas of study, including computer science, criminology, and psychology, before the theater department, with its freedom of emotional expression, drew him in.However, Renner recognized the potential in acting as much through the local police academy as through drama classes. During his second year at Modesto Junior College, Renner role-played a domestic disturbance perpetrator as part of a police-training exercise for an easy $50. Deciding to shift his focus away from schoolwork, Renner left college and moved to San Francisco to study at the American Conservatory Theater. From there he moved to Hawaii and, in 1993, to Los Angeles.In Los Angeles, Renner devoted himself to theater, most notably starring in and co-directing the critically acclaimed \"Search and Destroy.\" He pursued other projects during this time as well, landing his first film role in 1995\'s Senior Trip (1995). After several commercials and supporting roles in television movies and series, Renner captured the attention of critics with his gripping, complex portrayal of the infamous serial killer in the 2002 film Dahmer (2002).

In 2005, he played the leading role in Neo Ned (2005) as an institutionalized white supremacist in love with a black girl, winning the Palm Beach International Film Festival\'s best actor award.

Renner\'s performance as a single-minded bomb specialist scored him an Academy Award nomination for best actor. He also earned best actor nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards, the Screen Actors Guild, and the BAFTA Awards, as well as wins in this category from several film critics groups.In 2009, Renner starred in the short-lived TV series, The Unusuals (2009), and in 2010 he played the chilling but loyal criminal Jem in Ben Affleck bank-heist thriller Мiсто (2010).

He has also since starred in Месники (2012), Американська афера (2013), and Убити посланця (2014).Renner\'s strengths as an actor derive not only from his expressive eyes but also from his ability to thoroughly embody the characters he portrays. His visceral depiction of these individuals captivates audiences and empowers him to steal scenes in many of his films, even when playing a minor role. Renner gravitates toward flawed, complicated, three-dimensional characters that allow him to explore new territory within himself.In addition to his work as an actor, Renner continues to cultivate his lifelong love of music. A singer, songwriter, and musician, he performed with the band Sons of Ben early in his career. Scenes in Love Comes to the Executioner (2006), Пiвнiчна краiiна (2005), and Як боягузливий Роберт Форд вбив Джесi Джеймса (2007) briefly showcase Renner\'s singing talents.Despite traveling the world for film roles and, recently, as a United Nations Goodwill Peace Ambassador to raise awareness for mine-clearing efforts in Afghanistan, Renner remains close to his roots. In 2010, Modesto Junior College presented him the Distinguished Alumnus award in recognition of his body of work as an actor. He also headlined at a benefit for Modesto\'s Gallo Center for the Arts in the fall of 2010.Renner maintains a sense of humility and gratitude, even in the wake of his recent successes and recognition. He keeps himself grounded by renovating and restoring old and rundown iconic Hollywood homes, an enterprise he began back in his early days in Los Angeles. He values loyalty and a sense of both age and history, and enjoys the opportunity to help conserve these qualities in a town that favors the young and the new.'),(202,'Bradley Whitford','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwMzg3ODUxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc5MDcxNDM@._V1_UY317_CR16,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Bradley Whitford\'s credits in film, television and theater include work with some of the most noted writers, directors and playwrights in the arts, and constitute a career worthy of a Juilliard-trained actor -- which he is.

Nicholson is also notable for being one of two actors - the other being Michael Caine - who have received Oscar nomination in every decade from the 1960s through the early 2000s.Nicholson was born on April 22, 1937, in Neptune, New Jersey. He was raised believing that his grandmother was his mother, and that his mother, June Frances Nicholson, a showgirl, was his older sister. He discovered the truth in 1975 from a Time magazine journalist who was researching a profile on him. His real father is believed to have been either Donald Furcillo, an Italian American showman, or Eddie King (Edgar Kirschfeld), born in Latvia and also in show business. Jack\'s mother\'s ancestry was Irish, and smaller amounts of English, German, Scottish, and Welsh.Nicholson made his film debut in a B-movie titled The Cry Baby Killer (1958). His rise in Hollywood was far from meteoric, and for years, he sustained his career with guest spots in television series and a number of Roger Corman films, including The Little Shop of Horrors (1960).Nicholson\'s first turn in the director\'s chair was for Drive, He Said (1971). Before that, he wrote the screenplay for The Trip (1967), and co-wrote Head (1968), a vehicle for The Monkees. His big break came with Безтурботний байкер (1969) and his portrayal of liquor-soaked attorney George Hanson, which earned Nicholson his first Oscar nomination. Nicholson\'s film career took off in the 1970s with a definitive performance in Five Easy Pieces (1970). Nicholson\'s other notable work during this period includes leading roles in Roman Polanski\'s noir masterpiece Китайський квартал (1974) and Пролiтаючи над гнiздом зозулi (1975), for which he won his first Best Actor Oscar.The 1980s kicked off with another career-defining role for Nicholson as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick\'s adaptation of Stephen King\'s novel Сяйво (1980). A string of well-received films followed, including Мова нiжностi (1983), which earned Nicholson his second Oscar; Prizzi\'s Honor (1985), and Iствiкськi вiдьми (1987). He portrayed another renowned villain, The Joker, in Tim Burton\'s Бетмен (1989). In the 1990s, he starred in such varied films as Декiлька хороших хлопцiв (1992), for which he received another Oscar nomination, and a dual role in Марс атакуе! (1996).Although a glimpse at the darker side of Nicholson\'s acting range reappeared in Вiдступники (2006), the actor\'s most recent roles highlight the physical and emotional complications one faces late in life. The most notable of these is the unapologetically misanthropic Melvin Udall in Краще не буваe (1997), for which he won his third Oscar. Shades of this persona are apparent in Про Шмiдта (2002), Something\'s Gotta Give (2003), and Список останнiх бажань (2007).

His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Irish, Scottish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father\'s oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film.He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama Пiд кайфом та збентеженi (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Renée Zellweger.Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Зiрка шерифа (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham\'s novel Час убивати (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry\'s hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis\' Контакт (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg\'s Амiстад (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in The Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew\'s birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998).In 1999, he starred in the comedy Ед iз телевiзора (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow\'s U-571 (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine.In the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as The Wedding Planner (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and Як позбутися хлопця за 10 днiв (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Влада вогню (2002), where he co-starred with Christian Bale. In 2006, he starred in the romantic comedy Failure to Launch (2006), and later as head coach Jack Lengyel in Ми - одна команда (2006), along with Matthew Fox. In 2008, he played treasure hunter Benjamin \"Finn\" Finnegan in Золото дурнiв (2008), again with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in Привиди колишнiх подружок (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies.That change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in Адвокат на лiнкольнi (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Бернi (2011), the wild private detective \"Killer\" Joe Cooper in Кiлер Джо (2011), Mud in Мад (2012), reporter Ward Jensen in The Paperboy (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Супер Майк (2012), starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey\'s career certainly reached it\'s prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Далласький клуб покупцiв (2013), shot in less than a month. For his portrayal of Ron, Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, among other awards and nominations. The same year, he also appeared in Martin Scorsese\'s Вовк з Уолл-стрiт (2013). In 2014, he starred in HBO\'s Справжнiй детектив (2014), as detective Rustin Cohle, whose job is to investigate with his partner Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, a gruesome murder that happened in his little town in Louisiana. The series was highly acclaimed by critics winning 4 of the 7 categories it was nominated at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards; he also won a Critics\' Choice Award for the role.Also in 2014, Matthew starred in Christopher Nolan\'s sci-fi film Iнтeрстеллар (2014), playing Cooper, a former NASA pilot.'),(215,'Jon Favreau','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjcwNzg4MjktNDNlMC00M2U1LWJmMjgtZTVkMmI4MDI2MTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MDI0NTM@._V1_UY317_CR12,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1966-10-19','Initially an indie film favorite, actor Jon Favreau has progressed to strong mainstream visibility into the millennium and, after nearly two decades in the business, is still enjoying character stardom as well as earning notice as a writer/producer/director.The amiable, husky-framed actor with the tight, crinkly hair was born in Queens, New York on October 19, 1966, the only child of Madeleine (Balkoff), an elementary school teacher, and Charles Favreau, a special education teacher. His father has French-Canadian, German, and Italian ancestry, and his mother was from a Russian Jewish family. He attended the Bronx High School of Science before furthering his studies at Queens College in 1984. Dropping out just credits away from receiving his degree, Jon moved to Chicago where he focused on comedy and performed at several Chicago improvisational theaters, including the ImprovOlympic and the Improv Institute. He also found a couple of bit parts in films.While there, he earned another bit role in the film, Rudy (1993), and met fellow castmate Vince Vaughn. Their enduring personal friendship would play an instrumental role in furthering both their professional careers within just a few years. Jon broke into TV with a role on the classic series, Сайнфелд (1989) (as \"Eric the Clown\"). After filming rudimentary roles in the movies Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994), Notes from Underground (1995) and Batman Forever (1995), he decided to do some risk taking by writing himself and friend Vaughn into what would become their breakthrough film. Тусовщики (1996), which he also co-produced, centers on Jon as a luckless, struggling actor type who is emotionally shattered after losing his girlfriend, but is pushed back into the L.A. social scene via the help of cool, worldly, outgoing actor/buddy Vaughn. These two blueprint roles went on to define the character types of both actors on film.In 1997, Jon appeared favorably on several episodes of the popular TV sitcom, Друзi (1994), as \"Pete Becker\", the humdrum but extremely wealthy suitor for Courteney Cox\'s \"Monica\" character, and also appeared to fine advantage on the Tracey Takes On... (1996) comedy series. He later took on the biopic mini-movie, Rocky Marciano (1999), portraying the prizefighter himself in a highly challenging dramatic role and received excellent reviews. Other engagingly offbeat \"everyman\" films roles came Jon\'s way -- the ex-athlete in the working class film, Dogtown (1997); a soon-to-be groom whose bachelor party goes horribly awry in the comedy thriller Very Bad Things (1998); a newlywed opposite Famke Janssen in Love & Sex (2000); a wild and crazy linebacker in The Replacements (2000); as Ben Affleck\'s legal partner in Шибайголова (2003); and another down-and-out actor in The Big Empty (2003). He wrote and directed himself and Vaughn as two fellow boxers who involve themselves in criminal activity in Зроблено! (2001). Both he and Vaughn produced. He also directed the highly popular Will Ferrell comedy Ельф (2003), in which he had a small part.Jon went on to re-team favorably with his friend, Vince Vaughn, who enjoyed a meteoric rise into the comedy star ranks, in such light-weight features as The Break-Up (2006), Чотири Рiздва (2008) and Тiльки для закоханих (2009), the last of which he co-wrote with Vaughn. He also made great strides as a producer/director in recent years with the exciting mega-box office action-packed Залiзна людина (2008), starring Robert Downey Jr. and its sequel, Залiзна людина 2 (2010).Favreau\'s marriage to Joya Tillem on November 24, 2000, produced son Max and two daughters, Madeleine and Brighton Rose.

A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for Вiдступники (2006) who went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in Боeць (2010), Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in Третiй зайвий (2012).Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse\'s aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Irish, Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), and more distant French-Canadian, English, and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn\'t have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark\'s mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son\'s subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He\'d spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.The young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.Around this time, his older brother Donnie Wahlberg had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band New Kids on the Block. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.Donnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his \"Funky Bunch\" and \"Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\" was born. His debut album, \"Music for the People\", was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper\'s willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping \"bad boy\". Record producer David Geffen saw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer Calvin Klein, Marky Mark was set up as the designer\'s chief underwear model.His scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the New Kids on the Block\'s fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, \"Marky Mark\'s\" bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with Madonna and her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper Shabba Ranks, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, \"You Gotta Believe\", had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.Adding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the \"Marky Mark\" moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in Penny Marshall\'s Renaissance Man (1994). Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In Renaissance Man (1994), he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial The Basketball Diaries (1995) and chilled them in Fear (1996) as every father\'s worst nightmare.The major turning point in Wahlberg\'s career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in Paul Thomas Anderson\'s Ночi в стилi бугi (1997). Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as Три королi (1999) and Iдеальний шторм (2000), popcorn flicks like Планета Мавп (2001) and Контрабанда (2012), and even indies such as Змова (2004).Wahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as Boardwalk Empire (2010), In Treatment (2008) and the highly successful comedy Антураж (2004), which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham have four children.'),(228,'Adam Sandler','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyNzM2MjM1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE5NjI3Mg@@._V1_UY317_CR7,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1966-09-09','Adam Richard Sandler was born September 9, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York, to Judith (Levine), a teacher at a nursery school, and Stanley Alan Sandler, an electrical engineer.

He nurtured his talent while at New York University (graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991) by performing regularly in clubs and at universities. During his freshman year, he snagged a recurring role as the Huxtable family\'s friend Smitty on The Cosby Show (1984). While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was \"discovered\" by Dennis Miller, who recommended him to Saturday Night Live (1975) producer Lorne Michaels and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing. After Saturday Night Live (1975), Sandler went on to the movies, starring in such hit comedies as Airheads (1994), Щасливчик Гiлмор (1996), Billy Madison (1995) and Великий тато (1999).

He is known for his works with American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, receiving acclaim for portraying SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa in Безславнi виродки (2009) and bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Джанго вiльний (2012). For each performance, he won an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, he received the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his portrayal of Landa.Christoph Waltz was born in Vienna, Austria, to Elisabeth Urbancic, an Austrian-born costume designer, and Johannes Waltz, a German-born stage builder. He has three siblings. He was born into a theatre family, as his maternal grandmother was Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. His maternal grandfather, Rudolf von Urban, was a psychologist and psychiatrist who wrote the 1949 book \"Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness\".Waltz attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London.During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theatre, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however, attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful. Christoph has stated he is grateful to have made a living and supported his family through acting. For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner.It was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Безславнi виродки (2009) catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar and Academy Award-winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d\'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (which he won again for 2012\'s Джанго вiльний (2012)).He also portrayed computer genius Qohen Leth in the film Теорема Зеро (2013), American plagiarist Walter Keane in the biographical film _Big Eyes (2014), and 007\'s nemesis and head of SPECTRE Ernst Stavro Blofeld in _Spectre (2015)_.

Clever, courteous, and multilingual - but also self-serving, cunning, implacable, and murderous. Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky in Зелений шершень (2011). That same year, he starred in Води слонам! (2011), Roman Polanski\'s Рiзанина (2011), and a remake of Мушкетери (2011).

It\'s hard to believe that the actress, who slunk into stardom with her turn as the disillusioned daughter in Краса по-американськи (1999), is even related to the apple-cheeked blonde who once gazed up at Quaker Oats (R) spokesman Wilford Brimley and said, \"Mmm-hmm. Yeah, grandpa\", but Birch still remembers the professional advice Brimley whispered in her ear: maintain eye contact and *really* listen. Since then, she\'s had ample opportunity to study some of Hollywood\'s top talents at work - in addition to her Краса по-американськи (1999) scenes with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, she\'s acted alongside Harrison Ford, Harvey Keitel and Jeremy Irons. Named after Thor, the Norse god of thunder, Thora was born in Los Angeles to Jack Birch and Carol Connors Birch (they kept up the tempestuous theme by naming her younger brother Bolt Birch). By age 4, she was a regular at commercial auditions and, by age 6, she\'d landed a spot on the short-lived daycare sitcom Day by Day (1988). Her film career got off to an auspicious start that same year, when she won a Young Artist Award for her debut opposite Neil Patrick Harris in the children\'s fantasy flick Purple People Eater (1988). After a short break, she picked up a role in another fleeting sitcom, Parenthood (1990) (based on the movie of the same name). By age 9, Birch had her life pretty much figured out - she told the L.A. Times that she planned to become a director by 24, then spend a year ice skating, then spend a year as a policewoman, and, finally, become a singer. She picked up her last name (early appearances credited her as just \"Thora\") and returned to the big screen as Elijah Wood\'s tomboy friend in Paradise (1991). She then scored a high-profile supporting role as Harrison Ford\'s daughter in Patriot Games (1992), which she reprised in Clear and Present Danger (1994). In between, she kept busy with family films Hocus Pocus (1993) and Халепа з мавпою (1994). In 1995, Birch graduated into adolescent territory with her turn as a younger Melanie Griffith in Зараз i потiм (1995). She followed that up with a top-billed role in the snowy adventure Alaska (1996), then took a three-year hiatus from acting. She resurfaced in 1999, first in the made-for-TV Night Ride Home (1999) and then, more visibly, in Краса по-американськи (1999). Birch had heard about \"Beauty\" through the industry grapevine, and she immediately set her sights on the part of \"Jane Burnham\". As it turned out, she was the first to audition for director Sam Mendes; while he saw dozens of other actresses for the role, none delivered a more convincing \"Jane\". Still reeling from her sudden celebrity status, Birch plucked a handful of diverse projects from the deluge of post-\"Beauty\" scripts. Seeking an even edgier adolescent role, she appeared as a punk-rocker in the indie film The Smokers (2000), then dropped the tough-girl pose to play the gentle \"Empress Savina\" in the live-action adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons (2000). She also signed up to play a teen hipster caught up in a post-high school identity crisis in Свiт примар (2001) (based on the graphic novel), and an English schoolgirl in the thriller Яма (2001). Style-conscious and sophisticated beyond her years, Birch lives on her family\'s East L.A. ranch (where she recently finished high school through a computer-based correspondence course). She still hopes to try her hand at directing someday, but, for now, she\'s content to continue blossoming in front of the camera.'),(231,'Saoirse Ronan','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNTM5NDE4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMzEzOQ@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1994-04-12','Saoirse Una Ronan was born in The Bronx, New York City, New York, United States, to Irish parents, Monica Ronan (née Brennan) and Paul Ronan, an actor.

He was raised by his mother, a factory worker, and his grandparents. At Morehouse College, Jackson was active in the black student movement. In the seventies, he joined the Negro Ensemble Company (together with Morgan Freeman). In the eighties, he became well-known after three movies made by Spike Lee: Do the Right Thing (1989), Mo\' Better Blues (1990) and Jungle Fever (1991). He achieved prominence and critical acclaim in the early 1990s with films such as Patriot Games (1992), Amos & Andrew (1993), Справжнe кохання (1993), Парк Юрського перiоду (1993), and his collaborations with director Quentin Tarantino, including Кримiнальне чтиво (1994), Джекi Браун (1997), and later Джанго вiльний (2012). Going from supporting player to leading man, his performance in Кримiнальне чтиво (1994) gave him an Oscar nomination for his character Jules Winnfield, and he received a Silver Berlin Bear for his part as Ordell Robbi in Джекi Браун (1997).

His parents, Rose (Gerardi) and Sal Pacino, divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents\' house. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies, one of his favorite activities. Bored and unmotivated in school, the young Al Pacino found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting on the stage, he went through a lengthy period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally succeeded with Israel Horovitz\'s \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for \"Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\". His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in The Panic in Needle Park (1971) after his film debut in Me, Natalie (1969). What came next would change his life forever. The role of Michael Corleone in Хрещений батько (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O\'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of others either wanted it or were mentioned for it, but director Francis Ford Coppola had his heart set on the unknown Italian Pacino for the role, although pretty much everyone else--from the studio to the producers to some of the cast members--did not want him.Though Coppola won out through slick persuasion, Pacino was in constant fear of being fired during the hellish shoot. Much to his (and Coppola\'s) relief, the film was a monster hit that did wonders for everyone\'s career, including Pacino\'s, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Серпiко (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Собачий полудень (1975). He opened eyes around the film world for his brave choice of roles, and he was nominated three consecutive years for the \"Best Actor\" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with Правосуддя для всiх (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced such critical and commercial flops as Cruising (1980) and Author! Author! (1982).Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Обличчя зi шрамом (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino became terribly sick with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script also further derailed a project that seemed doomed from the start anyway. The Revolutionary War film is considered one of the worst films ever, not to mention one of the worst of his career, resulted in his first truly awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino has done much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking Sea of Love (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino\'s career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made Хрещений батько: Частина III (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Дiк Трейсi (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Гленгаррi Глен Росс (1992). He went into romantic mode for Frankie and Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Запах жiнки (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic. The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Шлях Карлiто (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Сутичка (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro, although they only had a few scenes together. He returned to the director\'s chair for the highly acclaimed and quirky Shakespeare adaptation Looking for Richard (1996). City Hall (1996), Доннi Браско (1997) and Адвокат диявола (1997) all came out in this period. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave two commanding performances in Своя людина (1999) and Any Given Sunday (1999).In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Тринадцять друзiв Оушена (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Angels in America (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie Ви не знаeте Джека (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.In his personal life, Pacino is one of Hollywood\'s most enduring and notorious bachelors, having never been married. He has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a set of twins with former longtime girlfriend Beverly D\'Angelo. His romantic history includes Veruschka von Lehndorff, Jill Clayburgh, Debra Winger, Tuesday Weld, Marthe Keller, Carmen Cervera, Kathleen Quinlan, Lyndall Hobbs, Penelope Ann Miller, and a two-decade intermittent relationship with \"Godfather\" co-star Diane Keaton. He currently lives with Argentinian actress Lucila Solá, who is 36 years his junior.With his intense and gritty performances, Pacino was an original in the acting profession. His Method approach would become the process of many actors throughout time, and his unbeatable number of classic roles has already made him a legend among film buffs and all aspiring actors and directors. His commitment to acting as a profession and his constant screen dominance has established him as one of the movies\' true legends.Pacino has never abandoned his love for the theater, and Shakespeare in particular, having directed the Shakespeare adaptation Looking for Richard (1996) and played Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (2004).'),(234,'Zoey Deutch','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2U0ZDMyMDctMTIwMy00YjcxLThmODktZmMwNjMxYTU0MzAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY317_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1994-11-10','Zoey Deutch was born in Los Angeles, California.

His parents, from the continental United States, were then serving as Children of God missionaries. His mother is from a Jewish family in New York, while his father, from California, is of mostly British Isles descent. As a youngster, Joaquin took his cues from older siblings River Phoenix and Rain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sisters Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix rounded out the talented troupe.The family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname \"Phoenix\" to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was age 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Arlyn found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into television work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other, less sinister products. Joaquin\'s first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River\'s sitcom, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982).He worked with his brother again on the afterschool special ABC Afterschool Specials: Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia (1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar romp SpaceCamp (1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era drama Russkies (1987). In the late \'80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River\'s film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn\'t sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent in Батьки (1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while--he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world.His parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (a Los Angeles nightclub partly-owned by Johnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 911, which was rebroadcast on radio and television the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work with Gus Van Sant (who had directed River in My Own Private Idaho (1991) and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)) to star as Nicole Kidman\'s obsessive devotee in Померти заради (1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics\' darling in his own right.His follow-up turn in Inventing the Abbotts (1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to his one-time fiancée Liv Tyler. (The pair dated for almost three years.) He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role in Oliver Stone\'s U Turn (1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat in Повернення до раю (1998). He and \"Paradise\" co-star Vince Vaughn re-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caper Clay Pigeons (1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in Вiсiм мiлiметрiв (1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was the historical epic Гладiатор (2000). The Roman epic cast him as the selfish, paranoid young emperor Commodus opposite Russell Crowe\'s swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. He received international attention and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for that role.Later that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker in The Yards (2000) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade\'s asylum in Пiр\'я маркiза де Сада (2000). He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as the legendary musician Johnny Cash in the biography Переступити межу (2005).

After his father died, his mother married Vernon Lynch, a foreman at a Breyer\'s Ice Cream plant. His brothers are Charlie Murphy & Vernon Lynch Jr. Eddie had aspirations of being in show business since he was a child. A bright kid growing up in the streets of New York, Murphy spent a great deal of time on impressions and comedy stand-up routines rather than academics. His sense of humor and wit made him a stand out amongst his classmates at Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School. By the time he was fifteen, Murphy worked as a stand-up comic on the lower part of New York, wooing audiences with his dead-on impressions of celebrities and outlooks on life.In the early 1980s, at the age of 19, Murphy was offered a contract for the Not-Ready-For-Prime-Time Players of Saturday Night Live (1975), where Murphy exercised his comedic abilities in impersonating African American figures and originating some of the show\'s most memorable characters: Velvet Jones, Mr. Robinson, and a disgruntled and angry Gumby. Murphy made his feature film debut in 48 Hrs. (1982), alongside Nick Nolte. The two\'s comedic and antagonistic chemistry, alongside Murphy\'s believable performance as a streetwise convict aiding a bitter, aging cop, won over critics and audiences. The next year, Murphy went two for two, with another hit, pairing him with John Landis, who later became a frequent collaborator with Murphy in Поiiздка в Америку (1988) and Полiцейський iз Беверлi Хiллз 3 (1994). Полiцейський iз Беверлi Хiллз (1984) was the film that made Murphy a box-office superstar and most notably made him a celebrity worldwide, and it remains one of the all-time biggest domestic blockbusters in motion-picture history. Murphy\'s performance as a young Detroit cop in pursuit of his friend\'s murderers earned him a third consecutive Golden Globe nomination. Axel Foley became one of Murphy\'s signature characters. On top of his game, Murphy was unfazed by his success, that is until his box office appeal and choices in scripts resulted into a spotty mix of hits and misses into the late 1980s and early 1990s.Films like The Golden Child (1986) and Полiцейський iз Беверлi Хiллз 2 (1987) were critically panned but were still massive draws at the box office. In 1989, Murphy, coming off another hit, Поiiздка в Америку (1988), found failure with his directorial debut, Harlem Nights (1989). Another 48 Hrs. (1990) and his turn as a hopeless romantic in Бумеранг (1992) did little to resuscitate his career. However, his remake of Jerry Lewis\'s Божевiльний професор 2. Родина Клампiв (1996) brought Murphy\'s drawing power back into fruition. From there, Murphy rebounded with occasional hits and misses but has long proven himself as a skilled comedic actor with laudable range pertaining to characterizations and mannerisms. Though he has grown up a lot since his fast-lane rise as a superstar in the 1980s, Murphy has lived the Hollywood lifestyle with controversy, criticism, scandal, and the admiration of millions worldwide for his talents. As Murphy had matured throughout the years, learning many lessons about the Hollywood game in the process, he settled down with more family-oriented humor with Доктор Дулiттл (1998), Мулан (1998), Bowfinger (1999), and the animated smash Шрек (2001), in a supporting role that showcased Murphy\'s comedic personality and charm. Throughout the 2000s, he further starred in the hits The Haunted Mansion (2003), Шрек 2 (2004), Дiвчата мрii (2006) (for which he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), Norbit (2007), Шрек Третiй (2007), and Шрек назавжди (2010).Murphy was married to Nicole Mitchell Murphy from 1993 to 2006.

Shortly after filming ended, Teresa decided to move permanently from Adelaide to Los Angeles following a public split from her then-boyfriend of two years, Australian Rules football star Stuart Dew. Teresa was due to play a small part in George Miller\'s doomed superhero film \"Justice League: Mortal\", but the production fell through after months of problems. Teresa briefly dated her \"Justice League: Mortal\" co-star Adam Brody in early 2008; later that year she had a relationship with British comedian Russell Brand, whom she met on the set of her latest film, Казки на нiч (2008), a Disney children\'s comedy starring Lucy Lawless, Guy Pearce and Keri Russell and was released on Christmas 2008.'),(247,'Kim Matula','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWI3MGM1NDItZmZhYy00YmYyLTg3NmYtNzFiMTdjY2Q0MGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAyOTc2MTE@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1988-08-23','Born in Fort Worth, Texas, Kim Matula has been acting since she was 12 years old and when she turned 15, she sent out her headshots and managed to land an agent.

While living there, Zoe discovered a keen interest in performance dance and began her training at the prestigious ECOS Espacio de Danza Dance Academy where she learned ballet as well as other dance forms. Not only did her training provide an excellent outlet for the enthusiastic and energetic youngster, it would also prove to be a fortunate precursor for the start of her professional acting career. At age 17, Zoe and her family moved back to the United States where her love for dance followed and an interest in theater performance became stronger.She began performing with the Faces theater troupe which put on plays geared to provide positive messages for teens with themes dealing with issues such as substance abuse and sex. These performances not only gave her valuable experience but also a source of great pride knowing that she was making a difference in the lives of young people like herself. While performing with the Faces troupe and also the New York Youth Theater, Zoe was recruited for a talent agency and her dance training years before coupled with her acting experience greatly helped her land her first big screen role as Eva Rodriguez, the talented and headstrong ballet dancer in the film Center Stage (2000).

He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Щелепи (1975), and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. He gained notoriety as an uncredited assistant editor on the classic western Wagon Train (1957). Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed Escape to Nowhere (1961), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister Anne Spielberg, and The Last Gun (1959), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed Firelight (1964), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed Slipstream (1967), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed Amblin\' (1968), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature so prominently. Amblin\' also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as Iншопланетянин (1982). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, Duel (1971), with Dennis Weaver. In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as Rod Serling\'s Night Gallery (1969), Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969) and Коломбо: Murder by the Book (1971). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world.Spielberg\'s first major directorial effort was The Sugarland Express (1974), with Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: Щелепи (1975). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic Близькi контакти третього ступеня (1977), a unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), and followed that effort with Used Cars (1980), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, Kurt Russell\\\\Jack Warden comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with Iндiана Джонс: У пошуках втраченого ковчега (1981), with Harrison Ford taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was Полтергейст (1982), but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story Iншопланетянин (1982). Spielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of Reese\'s Pieces in \"E.T.\" Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \"E.T.\" and \"Close Encounters\", where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up \"Raiders\" with Iндiана Джонс i Храм долi (1984), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as Бовдури (1985), and was the brains behind the little monsters in Гремлiни (1984). He also produced the cartoon Американський хвiст (1986), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985, however, was the blockbuster Назад у майбутнe (1985), which made Michael J. Fox an instant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book Барва пурпурова (1985), with Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed Iмперiя сонця (1987), a mixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though.The late 1980s found Spielberg\'s projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film Хто пiдставив кролика Роджера (1988). The next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed Always (1989) as well as Iндiана Джонс i останнiй хрестовий похiд (1989), and Назад у майбутнe 2 (1989). All three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama Dad (1989), with Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson, which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", he produced the animated series Tiny Toon Adventures (1990), Мультиманiя (1993), Pinky and the Brain (1995), Freakazoid! (1995), Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain (1998), Family Dog (1993) and Toonsylvania (1998). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as Земля первiсних часiв (1988), We\'re Back! A Dinosaur\'s Story (1993), Каспер (1995) (the live action version) as well as the live-action version of Флiнстоуни (1994), where he was credited as \"Steven Spielrock\". Spielberg also produced many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed Капiтан Крюк (1991) and produced such films as the cute fantasy Джо проти вулкану (1990) and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991). He also produced the unusual comedy thriller Arachnophobia (1990), Назад у майбутнe 3 (1990) and Гремлiни 2: Нова партiя (1990). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed Парк Юрського перiоду (1993), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced and directed Список Шиндлера (1993), a stirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes.As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as Маска Зорро (1998), Люди в чорному (1997) and Deep Impact (1998). However, it was on the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic Амiстад (1997), a spectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career: Врятувати рядового Раяна (1998), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to Закоханий Шекспiр (1998).Spielberg produced a series of films, including Еволюцiя (2001), The Haunting (1999) and Шрек (2001). he also produced two sequels to Парк Юрського перiоду (1993), which were financially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a financial and critical success: Брати по зброii (2001), a tale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was back in the director\'s chair for Штучний розум (2001), a movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics.Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series Seaquest DSV (1993), an anthology series entitled Amazing Stories (1985), created the video-game series \"Medal of Honor\" set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of Швидка допомога (1994). Spielberg, if you haven\'t noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and Tom Hanks collaborated on Shooting War (2000), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called A Holocaust szemei (2000). With all of this to Spielberg\'s credit, it\'s no wonder that he\'s looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.'),(256,'Bruce Willis','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MjMzMTE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ2ODE3Mw@@._V1_UY317_CR27,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for playing wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD, placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts.Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene K. (from Kassel), and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \"discovered\" whilst working in a café in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \"David Addison\" alongside sultry Cybill Shepherd in the hit romantic comedy television series Детективне агентство \"Мiсячне сяйво\" (1985). The series firmly established Bruce Willis as a hot new talent, and his sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. was in effect a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \"John McClane\" in the monster hit Мiцний горiшок (1988). This superbly paced action film balanced laconic humor and wholesale destruction as Willis\' character single handedly battles a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Willis reprized the role of tough guy cop \"John McClane\" in the eagerly anticipated sequel Мiцний горiшок 2 (1990) set at snowbound Washington\'s Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel Мiцний горiшок 3: Помирати з пiснею (1995) this time also starring Samuel L. Jackson as a cynical Harlem shopowner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in NYC.Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of \"Mikey\" the baby in the very popular family comedies Хто б казав (1989), and its sequel Ну, хто б казав (1990) also starring John Travolta and Kirstie Alley. Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. Вогнище марнославства (1990) and Hudson Hawk (1991) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyperviolent Останнiй бойскаут (1991), the darkly humored Смерть iiй личить (1992) and the mediocre police thriller На вiдстанi удару (1993). During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing North (1994), as a cagey prizefighter in the Quentin Tarantino directed mega-hit Кримiнальне чтиво (1994), the Terry Gilliam directed apocalyptic thriller Дванадцять мавп (1995), the Luc Besson directed sci-fi opus П\'ятий елемент (1997) and the M. Night Shyamalan directed spine-tingling epic Шосте чуття (1999).Willis next starred in the gangster comedy Дев\'ять ярдiв (2000), worked again with \"hot\" director M. Night Shyamalan in the less gripping Невразливий (2000), and in two military dramas, Вiйна Харта (2002) and Tears of the Sun (2003) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie Мiсто грiхiв (2005), the voice of \"RJ\" the scheming raccoon in the animated hit Лiсова братва (2006) and \"Die Hard\" fans rejoiced to see \"John McClane\" return to the big screen in the high tech Мiцний горiшок 4.0 (2007) aka \"Die Hard 4.0\".Willis was married to actress Demi Moore for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three daughters.'),(257,'Gina Carano','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MTAxOTM1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI5NzQyNw@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1982-04-16','From pioneering women\'s MMA to blazing a trail in movies, GINA CARANO is one of Hollywood\'s most unique rising stars.

Nielsen began her acting career working alongside her mother on the local revue and variety scene. At 18, she headed to Paris to continue her pursuit of acting, which led her to further work and study in Rome and Milan. In addition to being an accomplished actress, Nielsen is also a trained singer, dancer and is fluent in English, German, Danish, Swedish, French and Italian. She resides in New York.However, it was Nielsen\'s portrayal of \"Princess Lucilla\", opposite Russell Crowe\'s Maximus in Ridley Scott\'s Academy Award-winning Гладiатор (2000), which first garnered a mass appeal. She won Best Actress Awards from the Danish Academy Awards and from the San Sebastian Film Festival for her role in the Danish drama Brødre (2004) (aka Brothers), which was released by Focus Features and IFC Films. She then appeared in the World War II epic The Great Raid (2005) opposite Benjamin Bratt, Joseph Fiennes and James Franco for director John Dahl and produced by Miramax; the dramatic thriller Return to Sender (2004) directed by Bille August, which premiered at The Toronto Film Festival in 2004; and the black comedy Крижаний урожай (2005) with John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton and Randy Quaid, directed by Harold Ramis for Focus Features.

This rather inauspicious beginning would also set Lori Petty off on a career as a fighter and a misfit, types for which she would be best known.She spent her childhood traveling the US with her father, a Pentecostal minister. Her keen talents first lent themselves toward being a graphic artist in Omaha, Nebraska, but an impulsive desire to act quickly took precedence and soon she was off to New York, where she took acting classes and pounded the pavement for jobs.Going nowhere fast, she eventually headed for Los Angeles and finally found an \"in\". Following a number of mediocre TV roles, she won a bit of attention on the short-lived series Booker (1989) as a lippy secretary, then hit paydirt in secondary roles as an outrageous Cyndi Lauper wannabe in Cadillac Man (1990) and as Patrick Swayze\'s ex-girlfriend/waitress who hooks up with Keanu Reeves in На гребенi хвилi (1991).It looked like mainstream stardom might happen for the tomboy actress, especially after getting cast as Geena Davis\' bratty baseball-playing sister in the highly successful Iiхня власна лiга (1992).However, Lori was an intriguing, kooky sort and difficult to cast. Such disparate roles as a kind-hearted animal trainer in Звiльнiть Вiллi (1993) and the sole female recruit in Pauly Shore\'s inane comedy In the Army Now (1994) only proved the point.She seemed bent towards playing scrappy figures alongside the big action guys but started off on the wrong foot when she was replaced by Sandra Bullock in Sylvester Stallone\'s Руйнiвник (1993) due to \"artistic differences\".She did play a lone female cop in the thriller The Glass Shield (1994), then found her true calling as the bizarre cartoon heroine Tank Girl (1995), which was billed as \"a post-apocalyptic comedy\".The crop-haired, tough-as-nails actress has been taking it to the limit ever since, most recently co-starring with the similarly styled Gina Gershon in Prey for Rock & Roll (2003) as members of a punk rock band.'),(266,'Josh Brolin','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzYyMjQ0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0ODkyMg@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1968-02-12','Rugged features and a natural charm have worked for Josh Brolin, the son of actor James Brolin. He has played roles as a policeman, a hunter, and the President of the United States.Brolin was born February 12, 1968 in Santa Monica, California, to Jane Cameron (Agee), a Texas-born wildlife activist, and James Brolin. Josh was not interested at first in the lifestyle of the entertainment business, in light of his parents\' divorce, and both of them being actors. However, during junior year in high school, he took an acting class to see what it was like. He played Stanley in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and became hooked. His first major screen role was as the older brother in the film Бовдури (1985), based on a story by Steven Spielberg. He then immediately moved on to work on television, taking roles on such series as Private Eye: Pilot (1987) and The Young Riders (1989). \"Private Eye\" was a chance for Brolin to play a detective. \"The Young Riders\" was set just before the Civil War, and was co-directed by Brolin\'s father, James Brolin.After The Young Riders (1989), Brolin moved back to the big screen, with mediocre success. He played a supporting role in The Road Killers (1994), but the film was not a success. He followed up with the crime film Gang in Blue (1996), the romantic film Bed of Roses (1996), the thriller film Nightwatch (1997), and appeared with his father in My Brother\'s War (1997). However, nothing truly stuck out, especially not the box office flop The Mod Squad (1999). The 2000s initially brought no significant change in Brolin\'s career. He appeared in the independent film Slow Burn (2000), the sci-if thriller Людина-невидимка (2000) and starred on the television series Mister Sterling (2003). In 2004, he married actress Diane Lane and are still together.It was not until 2007 that Brolin received much acclaim for his films. He took a supporting role in the Quentin Tarantino-written Грайндхаус (2007) which was a two-part film accounting two horror stories. He also played two policemen that year: corrupt officer Nick Trupo in the crime epic Гангстер (2007), and an honest police chief in the emotional drama У долинi Ела (2007) which starred Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by Paul Haggis. However, it was his involvement in Старим тут не мiсце (2007) that truly pushed him into the limelight. The film, directed by the Coen brothers, was about a man (Brolin) who finds a satchel containing two million dollars in cash. He is pursued by an unstoppable assassin (Javier Bardem, who won an Oscar for his work) and his friend, a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). The film won four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.Brolin found high-profile work the next year, being cast as Supervisor Dan White in the film Milk (2008). His performance as the weak and bitter politician earned him an Oscar nomination, and Brolin received more praise for his fascinating portrayal of George W. Bush in the Oliver Stone film W. (2008). Despite the mediocre success of W. (2008), he was recognized as the best part of the film, and Milk (2008) was another triumph, critically and commercially.Brolin then acted in the smaller comedy Women in Trouble (2009) before landing a number of large roles in 2010. The first of these was the film based on the comic book figure Jonah Hex (2010). The film was a box office flop and critically panned, but Brolin also forged a second collaboration with legendary director Oliver Stone for Волл-стрiт: Грошi не сплять (2010). Brolin played a large role alongside such young stars as Carey Mulligan and Shia LaBeouf, and older thespians such as Michael Douglas, Eli Wallach, and Frank Langella. Brolin\'s character was Bretton James, a top banker in the film, and also the film\'s chief antagonist. Brolin also appeared in Woody Allen\'s London-based film You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010) and a second collaboration with the Coen Brothers, which was a remake of Справжня мужнiсть (1969).Despite his earlier mediocre success and fame, Brolin has maintained a choosiness in his films and, recently, these choices have paid off profoundly.

After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith\'s Тусовщики з супермаркету (1995) and Переслiдуючи Емi (1997) which were great for Ben\'s career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn\'t last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for Розумник Вiлл Хантiнг (1997), they gave it to their agent, Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn\'t willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, Розумник Вiлл Хантiнг (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben\'s breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.Affleck chose such roles in the blockbusters Армагеддон (1998), Закоханий Шекспiр (1998), and Перл Гарбор (2001). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits На чужiй смузi (2002), The Sum of All Fears (2002), and Шибайголова (2003), as well as the disappointing comedies Gigli (2003) and Пережити Рiздво (2004). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Hollywoodland (2006). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films Козирнi тузи (2006), Обiцяти - ще не одружитись (2009), Iгри влади (2009), and Extract (2009). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller Бувай, дитинко, бувай (2007), which starred his brother, Casey Affleck, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in Мiсто (2010), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Арго (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck\'s second Oscar win).In 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller Загублена (2014). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film Бетмен проти Супермена: На зорi справедливостi (2016), briefly reprised the character in Загiн самогубцiв (2016), and did so again in Лiга справедливостi (2017).Affleck married actress Jennifer Garner in 2005. The couple has three children. In June 2015, Affleck and Garner separated, and in April 2017 they filed for divorce.'),(268,'Angelina Jolie','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODg3MzYwMjE4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU5NzAzNw@@._V1_UY317_CR22,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1975-06-04','Angelina Jolie is an Academy Award-winning actress who rose to fame after her role in Перерване життя (1999), playing the title role in the \"Lara Croft\" blockbuster movies, as well as Мiстер i мiсiс Смiт (2005), Особливо небезпечний (2008), Солт (2010) and Чaклунка (2014). Off-screen, Jolie has become prominently involved in international charity projects, especially those involving refugees. She often appears on many \"most beautiful women\" lists, and she has a personal life that is avidly covered by the tabloid press.Jolie was born Angelina Jolie Voight in Los Angeles, California. In her earliest years, Angelina began absorbing the acting craft from her actor parents, Jon Voight, an Oscar-winner, and Marcheline Bertrand, who had studied with Lee Strasberg. Her good looks may derive from her ancestry, which is German and Slovak on her father\'s side, and French-Canadian, Dutch, Polish, and remote Huron, on her mother\'s side. At age eleven, Angelina began studying at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she was seen in several stage productions. She undertook some film studies at New York University and later joined the renowned Met Theatre Group in Los Angeles. At age 16, she took up a career in modeling and appeared in some music videos.In the mid-1990s, Jolie appeared in various small films where she got good notices, including Hackers (1995) and Foxfire (1996). Her critical acclaim increased when she played strong roles in the made-for-TV movies True Women (1997), and in George Wallace (1997) which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy nomination. Jolie\'s acclaim increased even further when she played the lead role in the HBO production Джiа (1998). This was the true life story of supermodel Gia Carangi, a sensitive wild child who was both brazen and needy and who had a difficult time handling professional success and the deaths of people who were close to her. Carangi became involved with drugs and because of her needle-using habits she became, at the tender age of 26, one of the first celebrities to die of AIDS. Jolie\'s performance in Джiа (1998) again garnered a Golden Globe Award and another Emmy nomination, and she additionally earned a SAG Award.Angelina got a major break in 1999 when she won a leading role in the successful feature Збирач кiсток (1999), starring alongside Denzel Washington. In that same year, Jolie gave a tour de force performance in Перерване життя (1999) playing opposite Winona Ryder. The movie was a true story of women who spent time in a psychiatric hospital. Jolie\'s role was reminiscent of Jack Nicholson\'s character in Пролiтаючи над гнiздом зозулi (1975), the role which won Nicholson his first Oscar. Unlike \"Cuckoo\", \"Girl\" was a small film that received mixed reviews and barely made money at the box office. But when it came time to give out awards, Jolie won the triple crown -- \"Girl\" propelled her to win the Golden Globe Award, the SAG Award and the Academy Award for best leading actress in a supporting role.With her new-found prominence, Jolie began to get in-depth attention from the press. Numerous aspects of her controversial personal life became news. At her wedding to her Hackers (1995) co-star Jonny Lee Miller, she had displayed her husband\'s name on the back of her shirt painted in her own blood. Jolie and Miller divorced, and in 2000, she married her Pushing Tin (1999) co-star Billy Bob Thornton. Jolie had become the fifth wife of a man twenty years her senior. During her marriage to Thornton, the spouses each wore a vial of the other\'s blood around their necks. That marriage came apart in 2002 and ended in divorce. In addition, Jolie was estranged from her famous father, Jon Voight.In 2000, Jolie was asked to star in Лара Крофт: Розкрадачка гробниць (2001). At first, she expressed disinterest, but then decided that the required training for the athletic role was intriguing. The Croft character was drawn from a popular video game. Lara Croft was a female cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond. When the film was released, critics were unimpressed with the final product, but critical acclaim wasn\'t the point of the movie. The public paid $275 million for theater tickets to see a buffed up Jolie portray the adventuresome Lara Croft. Jolie\'s father Jon Voight appeared in \"Croft\", and during filming there was a brief rapprochement between father and daughter.One of the Croft movie\'s filming locations was Cambodia. While there, Jolie witnessed the natural beauty, culture and poverty of that country. She considered this an eye opening experience, and so began the humanitarian chapter of her life. Jolie began visiting refugee camps around the world and came to be formally appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Some of her experiences were written and published in her popular book \"Notes from My Travels\" whose profits go to UNHCR.Jolie has stated that she now plans to spend most of her time in humanitarian efforts, to be financed by her actress salary. She devotes one third of her income to savings, one third to living expenses and one third to charity. In 2002, Angelina adopted a Cambodian refugee boy named Maddox, and in 2005, adopted an Ethiopian refugee girl named Zahara. Jolie\'s dramatic feature film За межею (2003) parallels some of her real life humanitarian experiences although, despite the inclusion of a romance between two westerners, many of the movie\'s images were too depressingly realistic -- the film was not popular among critics or at the box office.In 2004, Jolie began filming Мiстер i мiсiс Смiт (2005) with co-star Brad Pitt. The film became a major box office success. There were rumors that Pitt and Jolie had an affair while filming \"Smith\". Jolie insisted that because her mother had been hurt by adultery, she herself could never participate in an affair with a married man, therefore there had been no affair with Pitt at that time. Nonetheless, Pitt separated from his wife Jennifer Aniston in January 2005 and, in the months that followed, he was frequently seen in public with Jolie, apparently as a couple. Pitt\'s divorce was finalized later in 2005.Jolie and Pitt announced in early 2006 that they would have a child together, and Jolie gave birth to daughter Shiloh that May. They also adopted a three-year-old Vietnamese boy named Pax. The couple, who married in 2014 and divorced in 2019, continue to pursue movie and humanitarian projects, and now have a total of six children.'),(269,'Liam Hemsworth','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODI0MDc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM5MDk3MTE@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1990-01-13','Liam Hemsworth was born on January 13, 1990, in Melbourne, Australia, and is the younger brother of actors Chris Hemsworth and Luke Hemsworth.

Following in the footsteps of his older brothers, who went into acting in their teens, Liam scored his first audition at age sixteen and appeared on the Australian TV series Home and Away (1988) and McLeod\'s Daughters (2001) before taking on a recurring character role on the soap opera Neighbours (1985), in which his brother Luke had also appeared. Roles on TV shows The Elephant Princess (2008) and Satisfaction (2007) followed before Liam moved to the United States to pursue a big-screen career.After suffering two setbacks - his character was written out of the script for Нестримнi (2010) days before filming and he lost the title role of Тор (2011) to his brother Chris - Liam was cast opposite Miley Cyrus in the Nicholas Sparks drama The Last Song (2010). The two, who played love interests in the film, soon started dating, and Liam appeared in Cyrus\' music video \"When I Look at You.\" Following that film\'s modest commercial success, and the attendant press coverage of his rising career and high-profile romance, he was almost immediately thrust into leading man status, and was cast as Gale Hawthorne in the big-screen adaptation of the best-selling novel Голоднi iгри (2012). Following the blockbuster success of that film, Liam nabbed a number of roles, including a supporting part in Нестримнi 2 (2012) and leading roles in the war drama Молодi серця (2013), the crime drama Empire State (2013), and the thriller Параноя (2013).

He went to St Thomas Aquinas Secondary in Jordanhill, Glasgow, where he did well enough and started \'a little school band with a couple of mates\'.McAvoy toyed with the idea of the Catholic priesthood as a child but, when he was 16, a visit to the school by actor David Hayman sparked an interest in acting. Hayman offered him a part in his film The Near Room (1995) but despite enjoying the experience McAvoy didn\'t seriously consider acting as a career, although he did continue to act as a member of PACE Youth Theatre. He applied instead to the Royal Navy and had already been accepted when he was also offered a place at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD).He took the place at the RSAMD (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) and, when he graduated in 2000, he moved to London. He had already made a couple of TV appearances by this time and continued to get a steady stream of TV and movie work until he came to attention of the British public in 2004 playing car thief Steve McBride in the successful UK TV series Shameless (2004) and then to the rest of the world in 2005 as Mr Tumnus, the faun, in Disney\'s adaptation of C. S. Lewis\'s Хронiки Нарнii: Лев, чаклунка i чарiвна шафа (2005). In Останнiй король Шотландii (2006) McAvoy portrayed a Scottish doctor who becomes the personal physician to dictator Idi Amin, played by Forest Whitaker. McAvoy\'s career breakthrough came in Спокута (2007), Joe Wright\'s 2007 adaption of Ian McEwan\'s novel.Since then, McAvoy has taken on theatre roles, starring in Shakespeare\'s \'Macbeth\' (directed by Jamie Lloyd), which launched the first Trafalgar Transformed season in London\'s West End and earned him an Olivier award nomination for Best Actor. In January 2015, McAvoy returned to the Trafalgar Studios stage to play Jack Gurney, a delusional English earl, in the first revival of Peter Barnes\'s satire \'The Ruling Class\', a role for which he was subsequently awarded the London Evening Standard Theatre Award\'s Best Actor.On screen, McAvoy has appeared as corrupt cop Bruce Robertson in Багно (2013), a part for which he received a Scottish BAFTA for Best Actor, a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor, a London Critics Circle Film Award for British Actor of the Year and an Empire Award for Best Actor.

Her father was English and her mother is Brazilian, of Italian and Portuguese descent. Her surname comes from her mother\'s Italian grandfather. Thanks to her mother, Kaya grew up fluent in Brazilian Portuguese, as well as English. At the age of fourteen, she auditioned for Скiнс (2007), the debut series for new channel E4 that would become known for casting real teenagers like her, who had no professional acting experience, rather than experienced adult actors. She won the role of \"Effy Stonem\" and joined the show in January 2007. After an challenging debut in which she never spoke, Scodelario and Effy made quite an impression on viewers. At the forefront of many disasters, including stalkers, death, and sexual pressures, Effy became a fan favorite for her ability to resolve testing life situations while keeping her head above water. As the character and the role grew, Scodelario enjoyed depicting what she described as the realistic trials and challenges Effy faced with friendships, relationships, and adolescence. After two seasons of Скiнс (2007), the series endured an overhaul at the end of 2007. Feeling that most of the characters had run their course, the writers wrote out every character except Effy. This put significantly more pressure on Scodelario because it meant that she would be the most recognizable face for season three. As she waited for the new season of Скiнс (2007) to begin, she took advantage of her recent clout to seek out additional career opportunities. She joined the elite agency Models 1 and soon was featured as the cover model for SuperSuper Magazine. She made her feature film debut with a role in Мiсяць 2112 (2009), starring Sam Rockwell as an astronaut suffering from surreal encounters while on the moon.

Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise.Up until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of \"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian Oak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger\'s horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low budget Hercules in New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in Stay Hungry (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The mesmerizing Pumping Iron (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy Лиходiй (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie The Jayne Mansfield Story (1980).What Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Конан-варвар (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the \"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, \"Conan\" was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Конан-руйнiвник (1984) quickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold\'s movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - Термiнатор (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller Термiнатор (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I\'ll be back\" quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Коммандо (1985), Без компромiсiв (1986), Хижак (1987), Людина, що бiжить (1987) and Червона спека (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy Близнята (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as \"a condom stuffed with walnuts\". The spectacular Згадати все (1990) and \"feel good\" Дитсадковий полiцейський (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in Термiнатор 2: Судний день (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film\'s $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. Термiнатор 2: Судний день (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold\'s film career to date and he was voted \"International Star of the Decade\" by the National Association of Theatre Owners.Remarkably, his next film Останнiй кiногерой (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the \"James Bond\" style spy thriller Правдива брехня (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of Правдива брехня (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with Джунiор (1994) and Подарунок на Рiздво (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with Стирач (1996), as the chilling \"Mr. Freeze\" in Бетмен i Робiн (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of Кiнець свiту (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale Шостий день (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Вiдшкодування збиткiв (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception.It was time again to resurrect Arnold\'s most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for Термiнатор 3: Повстання машин (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of \"Sarah Connor\" aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing \"John Connor\" - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the \"Terminator\" series the weakest to date.Schwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children.In October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The \"Governator,\" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor\'s mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family\'s live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce.Schwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to Скарби Амазонки (2003), Навколо свiту за 80 днiв (2004) and The Kid & I (2005). Recently, he starred in Нестримнi 2 (2012), Повернення героя (2013), План втечi (2013), Нестримнi 3 (2014), and Термiнатор: Генезис (2015).'),(284,'Denzel Washington','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5NDU2Mzc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjAwNTE5OQ@@._V1_UY317_CR12,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Denzel Hayes Washington, Jr. was born on December 28, 1954 in Mount Vernon, New York.

He continued to define his onscreen persona as the tough, no-nonsense hero through the 2000s in films like Поза часом (2003), Лють (2004), Не впiймали - не злодiй (2006), and Захоплення пiдземки 1 2 3 (2009). Cerebral and meticulous in his film work, he made his debut as a director with Antwone Fisher (2002); he also directed The Great Debaters (2007) and Паркани (2016).In 2010, Washington headlined Книга Iлая (2010), a post-Apocalyptic drama.

In 2014, he starred in Праведник (2014), an action thriller film directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by Richard Wenk, based on the television series of same name starring Edward Woodward.

He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theatre manager, in an artists\' housing project in New York City\'s Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father\'s background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\".His first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin\'s fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York\'s hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel.Following high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \"Feature Films at used Car Prices\" by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called Multi-Facial (1995), which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. Multi-Facial (1995) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.Afterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, Strays (1997). Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. Steven Spielberg was impressed by Multi-Facial (1995) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in Врятувати рядового Раяна (1998). Multi-Facial (1995) earned Vin more work, when the director of Залiзний велетень (1999) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin\'s career steadily grew, with him securing his first lead role, as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film Чорна дiра (2000). The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves.Since then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles: Форсаж (2001), Три Iкси (2002), Лисий нянька (2005), Форсаж 4 (2009), Форсаж 5: Швидка п\'ятiрка (2011), Форсаж 6 (2013), and Форсаж 7 (2015).

Her mother is Judy Loe, who has appeared in a number of British dramas and sitcoms and continues to work as an actress, predominantly in British television productions. Her father was Richard Beckinsale, born in Nottingham, England. He starred in a number of popular British television comedies during the 1970s, most notably the series Rising Damp (1974), Porridge (1974) and The Lovers (1970). He passed away tragically early in 1979 at the age of 31.Kate attended the private school Godolphin and Latymer School in London for her grade and primary school education. In her teens she twice won the British bookseller W.H. Smith Young Writers\' competition - once for three short stories and once for three poems. After a tumultuous adolescence (a bout of anorexia - cured - and a smoking habit which continues to this day), she gradually took up the profession of acting.Her major acting debut came in a TV film about World War II called One Against the Wind (1991), filmed in Luxembourg during the summer of 1991. It first aired on American television that December. Kate began attending Oxford University\'s New College in the fall of 1991, majoring in French and Russian literature. She had already decided that she wanted to act, but to broaden her horizons she chose university over drama school. While in her first year at Oxford, Kate received her big break in Kenneth Branagh\'s film adaptation of William Shakespeare\'s Багато галасу з нiчого (1993). Kate worked in three other films while attending Oxford, beginning with a part in the medieval historical drama Принц Ютландii (1994), cast as Ethel. The film was shot during the spring of 1993 on location in Denmark, and she filmed her supporting part during New College\'s Easter break. Later in the summer of that year she played the lead in the contemporary mystery drama Uncovered (1994). Before she went back to school, her third year at university was spent at Oxford\'s study-abroad program in Paris, France, immersing herself in the French language, Parisian culture and French cigarettes.A year away from the academic community and living on her own in the French capital caused her to re-evaluate the direction of her life. She faced a choice: continue with school or concentrate on her flourishing acting career. After much thought, she chose the acting career. In the spring of 1994 Kate left Oxford, after finishing three years of study. Kate appeared in the BBC/Thames Television satire Cold Comfort Farm (1995), filmed in London and East Sussex during late summer 1994 and which opened to spectacular reviews in the United States, grossing over $5 million during its American run. It was re-released to U.K. theaters in the spring of 1997.Acting on the stage consumed the first part of 1995; she toured in England with the Thelma Holts Theatre Company production of Anton Chekhov\'s \"The Seagull\". After turning down several mediocre scripts \"and going nearly berserk with boredom\", she waited seven months before another interesting role was offered to her. Her big movie of 1995 was the romance/horror movie Haunted (1995), starring opposite Aidan Quinn and John Gielgud, and filmed in West Sussex. In this film she wanted to play \"an object of desire\", unlike her past performances where her characters were much less the siren and more the worldly innocent. Kate\'s first film project of 1996 was the British ITV production of Jane Austen\'s novel Emma (1996). Her last film of 1996 was the comedy Shooting Fish (1997), filmed at Shepperton Studios in London during early fall. She played the part of Georgie, an altruistic con artist.

She is the daughter of Nena Thurman (née Birgitte Caroline von Schlebrügge), a fashion model and socialite who now runs a mountain retreat, and of Robert Thurman (Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman), a professor and academic who is one of the nation\'s foremost Buddhist scholars. Uma\'s mother was born in Mexico City, Mexico, to a German father and a Swedish mother (who herself was of Swedish, Danish, and German descent). Uma\'s father, a New Yorker, has English, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry. Uma grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, where her father worked at Amherst College.Thurman\'s household was one in which the The Dalai Lama was an occasional guest; she and her siblings all have names deriving from Buddhist mythology; and Middle American behavior was little understood, much less pursued. And so it was that the young Thurman confronted childhood with an odd name and eccentric home life -- and nature seemingly conspired against her as well. She is six feet tall, and from an early age towered over everyone else in class. Her famously large feet would soon sprout to size 11 -- and even beyond that -- and although they would eventually be lovingly filmed by director Quentin Tarantino, as a child she generally wore the biggest shoes in class, which only provided another subject of ridicule. Even her long nose moved one of her mother\'s friends to helpfully suggest rhinoplasty -- to the ten-year-old Thurman. To make matters worse yet, the family constantly relocated, making the gangly, socially inept Thurman perpetually the new kid in class. The result was an exceptionally awkward, self-conscious, lonely and alienated childhood.Unsurprisingly, the young Thurman enjoyed making believe she was someone other than herself, and so thrived at acting in school plays -- her sole successful extracurricular activity. This interest, and her lanky frame, perfect for modeling, led the 15-year-old Thurman to New York City for high school and modeling work (including a layout in Glamour Magazine) as she sought acting roles. The roles soon came, starting with a few formulaic and forgettable Hollywood products, but immediately followed by Terry Gilliam\'s Пригоди барона Мюнхгаузена (1988) and Stephen Frears\' Небезпечнi зв\'язки (1988), both of which brought much attention to her unorthodox sensuality and performances that intriguingly combined innocence and worldliness. The weird, gangly girl became a sex symbol virtually overnight.Thurman continued to be offered good roles in Hollywood pictures into the early \'90s, the least commercially successful but probably best-known of which was her smoldering, astonishingly-adult performance as June, Henry Miller\'s wife, in Генрi та Джун (1990), the first movie to actually receive the dreaded NC-17 rating in the USA. After a celebrated start, Thurman\'s career stalled in the early \'90s with movies such as the mediocre Скажений пес i Глорiя (1993). Worse, her first starring role was in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993), which had endured a tortured journey from cult-favorite book to big-budget movie, and was a critical and financial debacle. Fortunately, Uma bounced back with a brilliant performance as Mia Wallace, that most unorthodox of all gangster\'s molls, in Tarantino\'s lauded, hugely successful Кримiнальне чтиво (1994), a role for which Thurman received an Academy Award nomination.Since then, Thurman has had periods of flirting with roles in arty independents such as A Month by the Lake (1995), and supporting roles in which she has lent some glamorous presence to a mixed batch of movies, such as Красивi дiвчата (1996) and The Truth About Cats & Dogs (1996). Thurman returned to smaller films after playing the villainess Poison Ivy in the reviled Joel Schumacher effort Бетмен i Робiн (1997) and Emma Peel in a remake of The Avengers (1998). She worked with Woody Allen and Sean Penn on Sweet and Lowdown (1999), and starred in Richard Linklater\'s drama Tape (2001) opposite Hawke. Thurman also won a Golden Globe award for her turn in the made-for-television film Hysterical Blindness (2002), directed by Mira Nair.A return to the mainstream spotlight came when Thurman re-teamed with Quentin Tarantino for Убити Бiлла (2003), a revenge flick the two had dreamed up on the set of Кримiнальне чтиво (1994). She also turned up in the John Woo cautioner Час розплати (2003) that same year. The renewed attention was not altogether welcome because Thurman was dealing with the break-up of her marriage with Hawke at about this time. Thurman handled the situation with grace, however, and took her surging popularity in stride. She garnered critical acclaim for her work in Убити Бiлла 2 (2004) and was hailed as Tarantino\'s muse. Thurman reunited with Кримiнальне чтиво (1994) dance partner John Travolta for the Get Shorty (1995) sequel Be Cool (2005) and played Ulla in Продюсери (2005).Thurman had been briefly married to Gary Oldman, from 1990 to 1992. In 1998, she married Ethan Hawke, her co-star in the offbeat futuristic thriller Гаттака (1997). The couple had two children, Levon and Maya.

She took dancing lessons and did a little modeling while living in Arizona, and she dreamed of going to college and later start her own dance studio.

Therefore, she dropped out of high school during her junior year, and she and her mom moved to Los Angeles, California so she could become an actress. She later obtained her diploma in California. There, she started taking acting classes and went to auditions almost every day. After living in LA for about four months, she landed the role of \'Ericka McCray\' on the NBC series A Brand New Life (1989).

A trendy, cosmopolitan presence in lightweight comedy, spirited adventure and spy intrigue, she appeared alongside some of Hollywood\'s most handsome male specimens. Although she was seldom called upon to do much more than frolic in the sun and/or playfully taunt and tempt her leading man as needed, this tangerine-topped stunner managed to do her job very, very well. A remarkably bright woman in real life, she was smart enough to play the Hollywood game to her advantage and did so for nearly two decades before looking elsewhere for fun and contentment.Jill St. John was born in 1940 in Los Angeles. On stage and radio from age 5, she was pretty much prodded by a typical stage mother. Making her TV debut in a production of \"A Christmas Carol,\" Jill began blossoming and attracting the right kind of attention in her late teens. She signed with Universal Pictures at age 16 and made her movie debut in Summer Love (1957) starring then-hot John Saxon. Moving ahead, she filled the bill as an exuberant, slightly dingy teen and as well as shapely love interest in such innocuous but fun films as The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker (1959) and Holiday for Lovers (1959), Who\'s Been Sleeping in My Bed? (1963), Who\'s Minding the Store? (1963) and Honeymoon Hotel (1964).Whether the extremely photogenic Jill had talent (and she did!) or not never seemed to be a fundamental issue with casting agents. By the late 1960s she had matured into a classy, ravishing redhead equipped with a knockout figure and sly, suggestive one-liners that had her male co-stars (and audiences) panting for more. She skillfully traded sexy quips with Anthony Franciosa in the engaging TV pilot to the hit series The Name of the Game (1968) and scored a major coup as tantalizing \"Bond girl\" Tiffany Case in 007: Дiаманти залишаються назавжди (1971) opposite Sean Connery\'s popular \"007\" character. She also co-starred with Bob Hope in the dismal Eight on the Lam (1967), but the connection allowed her to be included in a number of the comedian\'s NBC specials over the years. A part of Frank Sinatra\'s \"in\" crowd, she co-starred with him in both Come Blow Your Horn (1963) and Tony Rome (1967).On camera, Jill\'s glossy, jet-setting femme fatales had a delightful tongue-in-cheek quality to them. Off-camera, she lived the life of a jet-setter too and was known for her various romantic excursions with such eligibles as Sinatra and even Henry Kissinger. Of her four marriages, which included millionaire Neil Dubin, the late sports car racer Lance Reventlow, son of Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton, and popular easy-listening crooner Jack Jones, she seems to have found her soulmate in present husband Robert Wagner, whom she married in 1990 following an eight-year cohabitation. Jill worked with Wagner in the soapy drama Banning (1967) as well as the TV movies How I Spent My Summer Vacation (1967) and Навколо свiту за 80 днiв (1989).Abandoning acting out of boredom, she has returned only on rare occasions. She played against type as a crazed warden in the prison drama The Concrete Jungle (1982) and has had some fun cameos alongside Wagner both on film (Гравець (1992)) and even TV (Сайнфелд (1989)). In the late 1990s they started touring together in A.R. Gurney\'s popular two-person stage reading of \"Love Letters.\" Jill\'s lifelong passion for cooking (her parents were restaurateurs) has turned profitable over the years. She has written several cookbooks and actually appeared as a TV chef and \"in-house\" cooking expert on morning TV (Good Morning America (1975)). She also served as a food columnist for the \"USA Weekend\" newspaper.She was glimpsed more recently in the films The Calling (2002) and The Trip (2002) and she and Wagner had small roles as Santa and Mrs. Claus in the TV movie Пiвнiчний Полюс (2014).'),(313,'Summer Glau','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTE1NDY1YjEtMmI2YS00ZjEzLWI4ZGUtZWZiYzZjMzBjMWM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIxODU2NTc@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1981-07-24','Summer is a native of San Antonio, Texas.

Marisa has a brother, actor Adam Tomei. As a child, Marisa\'s mother frequently corrected her speech as to eliminate her heavy Brooklyn accent. As a teen, Marisa attended Edward R. Murrow High School and graduated in the class of 1982. She was one year into her college education at Boston University when she dropped out for a co-starring role on the CBS daytime drama As the World Turns (1956). Her role on that show paved the way for her entrance into film: in 1984, she made her film debut with a bit part in The Flamingo Kid (1984). Three years later, Marisa became known for her role as Maggie Lawton, Lisa Bonet\'s college roommate, on the sitcom A Different World (1987).Her real breakthrough came in 1992, when she co-starred as Joe Pesci\'s hilariously foul-mouthed, scene-stealing girlfriend in Мiй кузен Вiннi (1992), a performance that won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Later that year, she turned up briefly as a snippy Mabel Normand in director Richard Attenborough\'s biopic Чаплiн (1992), and was soon given her first starring role in Untamed Heart (1993). A subsequent starring role -- and attempted makeover into Audrey Hepburn -- in the romantic comedy Тiльки ти (1994) proved only moderately successful.Marisa\'s other 1994 role as Michael Keaton\'s hugely pregnant wife in Газета (1994) was well-received, although the film as a whole was not. Fortunately for Tomei, she was able to rebound the following year with a solid performance as a troubled single mother in Nick Cassavetes\' Unhook the Stars (1996) which earned her a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She turned in a similarly strong work in Welcome to Sarajevo (1997), and in 1998 did some of her best work in years as the sexually liberated, unhinged cousin of Natasha Lyonne\'s Vivian Abramowitz in Tamara Jenkins\' Slums of Beverly Hills (1998). Marisa co-starred with Mel Gibson in the hugely successful romantic comedy Чого хочуть жiнки (2000) and during the 2002 movie award season, she proved her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar win was no fluke when she received her second nomination in the same category for the critically acclaimed dark drama, У спальнi (2001). She also made a guest appearance on the animated TV phenomenon Сiмпсони (1989) as Sara Sloane, a movie star who falls in love with Ned Flanders. In 2006, she went on to do 4 episodes for Rescue Me (2004). She played Angie, the ex-wife of Tommy Calvin (Denis Leary)\'s brother Johnny (Dean Winters). At age 42, Marisa took on a provocative role in legendary filmmaker Sidney Lumet\'s melodramatic picture Before the Devil Knows You\'re Dead (2007), in which she appeared nude in love scenes with costars Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Marisa then took on another provocative role as a stripper in the highly acclaimed film Рестлер (2008) opposite Mickey Rourke. Her great performance earned her many awards from numerous film societies for Best Supporting Actress, a third Academy Award nomination, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe and a BAFTA.

Nathan\'s grandfather (on his father\'s side) at 6\'7\", was a Caber tossing champion in New Zealand, while his great grandfather at 6\'5\", known for his adept swimming skills and champion medals, joined the police force, and was inducted into their Nautical task-force, also due to his nautical engineering background as well.

Nathan most notably appeared alongside The Undertaker at WrestleMania XIX, as well as part of Team Lesnar at Survivor Series 2003. He was known as \"The Colossus of Boggo Road\", a title referring to his time spent in Boggo Road Gaol, a notorious maximum-security Australian prison. Although he was sentenced for the crime of string armed robberies, it was not done out of personal greed or avarice, but due to the unfairness and inequality of the system.Nathan\'s introduction to the world of film & acting was after he caught the attention of martial arts movie icon Jackie Chan, who flew him to the Gold Coast for an audition for the movie \"Police Story 4: First Strike\". Jackie Chan saw him on the Good Morning Australia Show picking up the back of a Ford truck and pushed it for 30m. He even asked Nathan to do a jumping spin kick 8ft in the air!

Then as the infamous Rictus Erectus in acclaimed Oscar-winning Australian film \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", son of \'The Immortan Joe\', as his right-hand man and successor, he undoubtedly stands tall and out from the crowd.

Her interest in acting grew after meeting Lee Strasberg in 1958 and joining the Actors Studio.

Her professional success contrasted with her personal life, which was often laden with scandal and controversy.

He left school early to make his West End debut and has been dazzling audiences and critics with his intense and passionate performances ever since. Among his most memorable roles were \"Romeo\" in \"Romeo and Juliet\", the title role in Yukio Ninagawa\'s 1994 Royal Shakespeare Company\'s staging of \"Peer Gynt\" and \"Jimmy Porter\" both in a 1994 regional staging in a 1999 London revival of \"Look Back in Anger\". A critic from the London Times panned the multimedia production of \"Peer Gynt\", but praised Sheen for his ability to express \"astonishing vitality despite lifeless direction\". Referring to Sheen\'s performance in \"Look Back in Anger\", Susannah Clapp of The Observer hailed him for his \"luminous quality\" and ability to be goaded and fiery and defensive all at the same time. Sheen also managed to set critics\' tongues wagging with a deft performance in the role of \"Henry V\", not a part traditionally given to a slight, boyish-looking actor.

Perhaps his most memorable big screen role at that point, however, was \"Robert Ross\", Oscar Wilde\'s erstwhile lover, in the 1997 biopic Wilde (1997). He would also be seen in the Brit road film Heartlands (2002) opposite Mark Addy.Hot off the success of \"Amadeus\", Sheen began racking up even more notable big screen credits, starring opposite Heath Ledger, Wes Bentley and Kate Hudson in Чотири пера (2002) and landing a major role opposite Kate Beckinsale in the action-horror blockbuster Iнший свiт (2003), along with supporting turns in Сяюча молодь (2003), Timeline (2003) and as British Prime Minister Tony Blair in director Stephen Frears\' film Королева (2006).

Her parents were both from Russian Jewish families. Raised in the South Bronx and Queens, New York area, she wanted to be an actress as early as her teens and was eventually accepted into Manhattan\'s High School of the Performing Arts.Barkin then attended Hunter College and received her degree after double majoring in history and drama. At one point she wanted to teach ancient history, but instead turned her thoughts back to her first love: acting. Barkin then continued her education at New York\'s Actor\'s Studio. Fearful of the auditioning process, she studied acting for seven years before finally landing her first audition. While continuing her studies, she worked as a waitress at the avant-garde Ocean Club. Performing off-Broadway in such plays \"Shout Across the River\" (1979), \"Extremities\" (1983), \"Fool for Love\" (1984) and \"Eden Court\" (1985), she was applauded across the board for her first film lead in Забiгайлiвка (1982) opposite Mickey Rourke and Daniel Stern, and pursued sexy tough-cookie status thereafter with such quirky roles in The Big Easy (1986) starring Dennis Quaid and Siesta (1987) with Irish actor Gabriel Byrne, whom she married in 1987 and separated from in 1993 after producing a son and daughter. She and Byrne divorced in 1999.With trademark squinting eyes and slightly off-kilter facial features, Barkin continued the fascination of her seamy/steamy girl-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks status most notably opposite Al Pacino in the thriller Sea of Love (1989).

Other impressionable offbeat projects included roles in Страх i огида в Лас-Вегасi (1998), Вбивча краса (1999) and Mercy (2000). On TV, she was well-cast in the mini-movie Clinton and Nadine (1988) and won an Emmy award for her gripping performance in Before Women Had Wings (1997) opposite Oprah Winfrey as another abused wife who, in this case, turns her violent anger on her own daughters.In 2000, Barkin married billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, eleven years her senior and chairman of the Revlon company, and put her career relatively on hold, appearing sporadically in edgy films like She Hate Me (2004) and Palindromes (2004). Barkin and Perelman went through an acrimonious divorce in 2006.Just prior to her divorce in late 2005, Barkin ventured into independent film production with Applehead Pictures, a company she set up with her brother George Barkin, who is a scriptwriter and former editor-in-chief of National Lampoon and High Times, and former Independent Film Channel executive Caroline Kaplan. In her first major acting appearance since her divorce from Perelman, Barkin co-starred in Тринадцять друзiв Оушена (2007) with George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and former co-star Pacino. She followed up Ocean\'s with a supporting role in Antoine Fuqua\'s Brooklyn\'s Finest (2009), Happy Tears (2009) with Parker Posey and Demi Moore, and Twelve (2010).Recently, Barkin has produced features, including Листи до Джульeтти (2010) and Another Happy Day (2011) (she also starred in the latter project).

Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer\'s The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival\'s The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets\' drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including \"Easy Reader\", \"Mel Mounds\" and \"Count Dracula\" on the Children\'s Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children\'s adventure, Who Says I Can\'t Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Водiй мiс Дейзi (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Слава (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.His star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in Вогнище марнославства (1990), Робiн Гуд: принц злодiiв (1991), and The Power of One (1992). Freeman\'s next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in Clint Eastwood\'s de-mythologized western Непрощенний (1992). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for Gene Hackman, a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on Bopha! (1993) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.More strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker Tim Robbins in Втеча з Шоушенка (1994). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in Сiм (1995), starred alongside Keanu Reeves in Ланцюгова реакцiя (1996), and was pursuing another serial murderer in Kiss the Girls (1997).Further praise followed for his role in the slave tale of Амiстад (1997), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in Deep Impact (1998), appeared in Neil LaBute\'s black comedy Nurse Betty (2000), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in Along Came a Spider (2001). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama The Sum of All Fears (2002), was a military officer in the Stephen King-inspired Dreamcatcher (2003), gave divine guidance as God to Jim Carrey in Брюс Всемогутнiй (2003), and played a minor role in the comedy The Big Bounce (2004).2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend Clint Eastwood to appear in the drama, Крихiтка на мiльйон доларiв (2004). Freeman\'s on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer Hilary Swank. Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy\'s judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated Steven Spielberg\'s Вiйна свiтiв (2005) and appeared in Бетмен: Початок (2005) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of Christian Bale\'s Bruce Wayne/Batman for director Christopher Nolan. Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.Roles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in Щасливе число Слевiна (2006), a second go-round as God in Еван Всемогутнiй (2007) with Steve Carell taking over for Jim Carrey, and a supporting role in Ben Affleck\'s directorial debut, Бувай, дитинко, бувай (2007). He co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the breakout hit Список останнiх бажань (2007) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, Особливо небезпечний (2008), then segued into the second Batman film, Темний лицар (2008).In 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director\'s true-life drama Непiдкорений (2009), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics\' Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.Recently, Freeman appeared in РЕД (2010), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the Конан-варвар (2011) remake, starred in Rob Reiner\'s The Magic of Belle Isle (2012); and capped the Batman trilogy with Темний лицар повертаеться (2012).

The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to fame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy In Living Color (1990) but leading roles in Ейс Вентура: Детектив з розшуку домашнiх тварин (1994), Тупий та ще тупiший (1994) and Маска (1994) established him as a bankable comedy actor.James Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname was originally \"Carré\", and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child, he performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed his résumé to The Carol Burnett Show (1967) at age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the end of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates (provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).Carrey\'s early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when the family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to Scarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial jobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after school let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered). When they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a Volkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.Carrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and siblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful) professional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk\'s, one of the many local clubs that would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He dropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations (among them Michael Landon and James Stewart), and in 1979 worked up the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular gig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed Rodney Dangerfield so much that the veteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During this period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he had a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy divorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress Lauren Holly. Wary of falling into the lounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance outlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived sitcom The Duck Factory (1984); while the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to pursue acting more vigorously.Carrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored the male lead in the ill-received Lauren Hutton vehicle Once Bitten (1985), and had a supporting role in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), before making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc in Earth Girls Are Easy (1988). Impressed with Carrey\'s lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial Damon Wayans made a call to his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans, who was in the process of putting together the sketch comedy show In Living Color (1990). Carrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with outrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire Marshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill- advised safety tips).Following his time on In Living Color (1990), Carrey\'s transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened within the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn in Ейс Вентура: Детектив з розшуку домашнiх тварин (1994), a film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the character\'s trademark was talking out his derrière). Next up was the manic superhero movie Маска (1994), which had audiences wondering just how far Carrey\'s features could stretch.Finally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the Farrelly brothers\' Тупий та ще тупiший (1994) (his first multi-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought his manic antics onto the set of Batman Forever (1995), replacing Robin Williams as The Riddler. He also filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough, Ейс Вентура: Поклик природи (1995), and inked a deal with Sony to star in Кабельник (1996) (replacing Chris Farley) for a cool $20 million--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been offered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a disappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced back the next year with the energetic hit Брехун, брехун (1997). Worried that his comic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.In 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in Peter Weir\'s Шоу Трумена (1998) playing a naive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a TV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took moviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and fans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn\'t materialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their narrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey threw himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a handful of other hopefuls (including Edward Norton) to play eccentric funnyman Andy Kaufman in Людина з Мiсяця (1999), Carrey disappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery alter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman\'s bongo drums, which he\'d used during his audition for director Milos Forman). His sometimes uncanny impersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again the Academy kept quiet.An indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly brothers in Я, знову я та Iрен (2000), playing a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with the same woman (Renée Zellweger). Carrey\'s real-life persona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film wrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then, Carrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy antihero of Ron Howard\'s Як Грiнч украв Рiздво (2000).Although Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films such as Брюс Всемогутнiй (2003) and Пiнгвiни мiстера Поппера (2011), he is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as demonstrated in films like Вiчне сяйво чистого розуму (2004) and the drama/comedy Завжди кажи ТАК (2008). In 2013, he costars with Steve Carell in The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013).Carrey has one child with his first wife, Melissa Carrey, whom he divorced in 1995. He married actress Lauren Holly in 1996, but they split less than a year later.'),(349,'Dermot Mulroney','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM2ODM3NTc3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTYwMzM0._V1_UY317_CR22,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1963-10-31','Dermot Mulroney was born in Alexandria, Virginia, to Ellen and Michael Mulroney, a law professor at Villanova.

He grew up in Barnes, southwest London with two older sisters and attended Tower House School until the age of 12, and then The Harrodian School. He discovered his love for music long before acting and started learning the guitar and piano at the age of four. He became a big cinephile for love of auteur cinema in his early teens and preferred to watch films rather than doing his homework. In his late teens and early twenties, he used to perform solo acoustic guitar gigs at open mic nights in bars and pubs around London where he sung his own written songs.Thinking about becoming a musician or going to university to study speech-writing, he never thought about pursuing an acting career and his drama teacher in school even advised him not to join the drama club because she thought he wasn\'t made for the creative subjects. But as a teenager, he joined the local amateur theatre club after his father convinced him to attend because he was quite shy. At age 15 and after two years of working backstage, he auditioned for the play \'Guys and Dolls\' and he got his first role as a Cuban dancer with no lines. He got the lead part in the next play \'Our Town\', was spotted by a talent agent who was sitting in the audience and he began looking for professional roles.His first screen role was a small part in Ярмарок марнославства (2004), but he\'d been cut out of the final film and didn\'t know about it until he attended the premiere. The casting director felt so guilty for not telling him, that she got him the audition for Гаррi Поттер i келих вогню (2005). He was lucky and succeeded in gaining the role of Cedric Diggory, which brought him to a wider audience at the age of 19 and he continued to star in mostly smaller British TV productions. Hollywood expressed only mild interest in him and he was still debating whether or not he wished to pursue acting.Throughout that period, Pattinson would occasionally send audition tapes for roles in America. One, for a rom-com, led to the opportunity for an in-person audition in Los Angeles. That audition did not pan out, but while in town he went in for another, with Тринадцять (2003) director Catherine Hardwicke, for a part in what he understood to be an indie movie based on a low-profile book about a vampire. Being the last one out of 3000 male actors to audition for the part, the role of Edward Cullen in the film adaptations of the Twilight novels written by Stephenie Meyer brought him to unexpected worldwide stardom at age 22 and the five films between 2008 and 2012 grossed over $3.3 billion in worldwide receipts. Between the Twilight Saga films, he also starred in Пам\'ятай мене (2010), Води слонам! (2011) and Любий друг (2012).Pattinson\'s Twilight-era was surreal. He had been catapulted onto Hollywood\'s A-list as a heartthrob, but also experienced a loss of privacy and certain preconceptions about what he wanted - or was capable of doing - as an actor. That changed with an unexpected straight offer from auteur director David Cronenberg to star in Космополiс (2012), which he described as an eye-opening experience: It reminded him of his love for cinema, why he wanted to become an actor in the first place and solidified his foremost desire for the coming years to work with great filmmakers. With Pattinson being a big cinephile, he since then starred in mostly independent films from respected auteur directors, such as Ровер (2014), Зоряна карта (2014), Life (2015), Королева пустелi (2015) and The Childhood of a Leader (2015). His unrecognizable role as an explorer in the amazon jungle in The Lost City of Z (2016) from director James Gray brought him much critical acclaim. His transformation to a sleazy, manic conman in the gritty crime thriller Гарнi часи (2017) earned a six-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and brought him a nomination for Best Actor at the Independent Spirit Awards. It was a major step for his transition into a character actor with incredible range, with critics calling his performance a revelation and career-defining.He starred in the western-comedy Damsel (2018) as a cowboy with sociopathic characteristics and played a convict sent to space for sexual experimentation in the psychological mystery drama На висотi (2018) from acclaimed French auteur director Claire Denis. He returned to work with director David Michôd in The King (2019) and starred in the fantasy-horror movie The Lighthouse (2019) from director Robert Eggers.'),(351,'Emily Browning','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMDk4MDE0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI3NDE5MDI@._V1_UY317_CR175,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1988-12-07','Australian actress Emily Browning was born in 1988 in Melbourne, Australia, to Shelley and Andrew Browning.

Emily found an agent and was soon filming on location for the Hallmark TV-movie, The Echo of Thunder (1998). She received more roles from there, including parts in The Man Who Sued God (2001), opposite Billy Connolly, and Ned Kelly (2003), opposite Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom.

Emily says she tries to avoid \"cheesy\" movies, and her big break came when she was on a press tour in LA for Ghost Ship (2002), that was filmed in Australia and released in America. In the same year, she won an Australian Film Institute Award for Best Young Actress, and was nominated for the same award, the next year. Emily received some scripts when she was in LA and sent in a video audition for Лемонi Снiкет: Тридцять три нещастя (2004).

In 1989, he had his screen debut in The Rachel Papers (1989).In 1990, while on vacation in New York, Jared auditioned for the role of Hotspur in \"Henry IV, Part 1\", which he played at the New York Shakespeare Festival following his brilliant course as an excellent theater artist in the off-Broadway play \"Ecstasy\", for which he was honored with an Obie Award in 1992.Widely regarded as the one of greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally, from his breakthrough role as Andy Warhol in I Shot Andy Warhol (1996) and VH1\'s Two of Us (2000) where he portrayed John Lennon to Шерлок Холмс: Гра тiней (2011) and Лiнкольн (2012), Jared Harris expressed his unparalleled qualities as a sublime \"chameleon\" in a wide range of roles full of profoundness, intelligence and insights through his praised performances, among others, in Останнiй iз могiкан (1992), Природженi вбивцi (1994), Дим (1995), Щастя (1998), How to Kill Your Neighbor\'s Dog (2000), Igby Goes Down (2002), B.

Beginning as a child star on a local Australian TV show, Russell\'s first big break came with two films ... the first, Romper Stomper (1992), gained him a name throughout the film community in Australia and the neighboring countries. The second, The Sum of Us (1994), helped put him on the American map, so to speak. Sharon Stone heard of him from Romper Stomper (1992) and wanted him for her film, The Quick and the Dead (1995). But filming on The Sum of Us (1994) had already begun. Sharon is reported to have held up shooting until she had her gunslinger-Crowe, for her film. With The Quick and the Dead (1995) under his belt as his first American film, the second was offered to him soon after. Virtuosity (1995), starring Denzel Washington, put Russell in the body of a Virtual Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far. Virtuosity (1995), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers.

She is the daughter of actor Will Knightley and actress turned playwright Sharman Macdonald. An older brother, Caleb Knightley, was born in 1979. Her father is English, while her Scottish-born mother is of Scottish and Welsh origin. Brought up immersed in the acting profession from both sides - writing and performing - it is little wonder that the young Keira asked for her own agent at the age of three. She was granted one at the age of six and performed in her first TV role as \"Little Girl\" in Screen One: Royal Celebration (1993), aged seven.It was discovered at an early age that Keira had severe difficulties in reading and writing. She was not officially dyslexic as she never sat the formal tests required of the British Dyslexia Association. Instead, she worked incredibly hard, encouraged by her family, until the problem had been overcome by her early teens. Her first multi-scene performance came in A Village Affair (1995), an adaptation of the lesbian love story by Joanna Trollope. This was followed by small parts in the British crime series The Bill (1984), an exiled German princess in The Treasure Seekers (1996) and a much more substantial role as the young \"Judith Dunbar\" in Giles Foster\'s adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher\'s novel Coming Home (1998), alongside Peter O\'Toole, Penelope Keith and Joanna Lumley. The first time Keira\'s name was mentioned around the world was when it was revealed (in a plot twist kept secret by director George Lucas) that she played Natalie Portman\'s decoy \"Padme\" to Portman\'s \"Amidala\" in Зорянi вiйни: Епiзод 1 - Прихована загроза (1999). It was several years before agreement was reached over which scenes featured Keira as the queen and which featured Natalie!Keira had no formal training as an actress and did it out of pure enjoyment. She went to an ordinary council-run school in nearby Teddington and had no idea what she wanted to do when she left. By now, she was beginning to receive far more substantial roles and was starting to turn work down as one project and her schoolwork was enough to contend with. She reappeared on British television in 1999 as \"Rose Fleming\" in Alan Bleasdale\'s faithful reworking of Charles Dickens\' Oliver Twist (1999), and traveled to Romania to film her first title role in Walt Disney\'s The Wonderful World of Disney: Princess of Thieves (2001) in which she played Robin Hood\'s daughter, Gwyn. Keira\'s first serious boyfriend was her The Wonderful World of Disney: Princess of Thieves (2001) co-star Del Synnott, and they later co-starred in Peter Hewitt\'s \'work of fart\' Thunderpants (2002). Nick Hamm\'s dark thriller Яма (2001) kept her busy during 2000, and featured her first nude scene (15 at the time, the film was not released until she was 16 years old). In the summer of 2001, while Keira studied and sat her final school exams (she received six A\'s), she filmed a movie about an Asian girl\'s (Parminder Nagra) love for football and the prejudices she has to overcome regarding both her culture and her religion). Bend It Like Beckham (2002) was a smash hit in football-mad Britain but it had to wait until another of Keira\'s films propelled it to the top end of the US box office. Bend It Like Beckham (2002) cost just £3.5m to make, and nearly £1m of that came from the British Lottery. It took £11m in the UK and has since gone on to score more than US$76m worldwide.Meanwhile, Keira had started A-levels at Esher College, studying Classics, English Literature and Political History, but continued to take acting roles which she thought would widen her experience as an actress. The story of a drug-addicted waitress and her friendship with the young son of a drug-addict, Pure (2002), occupied Keira from January to March 2002. Also at this time, Keira\'s first attempt at Shakespeare was filmed. She played \"Helena\" in a modern interpretation of a scene from \"A Midsummer Night\'s Dream\" entitled The Seasons Alter (2002). This was commissioned by the environmental organization \"Futerra\", of which Keira\'s mother is patron. Keira received no fee for this performance or for another short film, New Year\'s Eve (2002), by award-winning director Col Spector. But it was a chance encounter with producer Andy Harries at the London premiere of Щоденник Брiджит Джонс (2001) which forced Keira to leave her studies and pursue acting full-time. The meeting lead to an audition for the role of \"Larisa Feodorovna Guishar\" - the classic heroine of Boris Pasternak\'s novel Доктор Живаго (2002), played famously in the David Lean movie by Julie Christie. This was to be a big-budget TV movie with a screenplay written by Andrew Davies. Keira won the part and the mini-series was filmed throughout the Spring of 2002 in Slovakia, co-starring Sam Neill and Hans Matheson as \"Yuri Zhivago\". Keira rounded off 2002 with a few scenes in the first movie to be directed by Blackadder and Vicar of Dibley writer Richard Curtis. Called Реальне кохання (2003), Keira played \"Juliet\", a newlywed whose husband\'s Best Man is secretly besotted with her. A movie filmed after Реальне кохання (2003) but released before it was to make the world sit up and take notice of this beautiful fresh-faced young actress with a cute British accent. It was a movie which Keira very nearly missed out on, altogether. Auditions were held in London for a new blockbuster movie called Пiрати Карибського моря: Прокляття Чорноii перлини (2003), but heavy traffic in the city forced Keira to be tagged on to the end of the day\'s auditions list. It helped - she got the part. Filming took place in Los Angeles and the Caribbean from October 2002 to March 2003 and was released to massive box office success and almost universal acclaim in the July of that year.Meanwhile, a small British film called Bend It Like Beckham (2002) had sneaked onto a North American release slate and was hardly setting the box office alight. But Keira\'s dominance in \"Pirates\" had set tongues wagging and questions being asked about the actress playing \"Elizabeth Swann\". Almost too late, \"Bend It\"\'s distributors realized one of its two stars was the same girl whose name was on everyone\'s lips due to \"Pirates\", and took the unusual step of re-releasing \"Bend It\" to 1,000 screens across the US, catapulting it from no. 26 back up to no. 12. \"Pirates\", meanwhile, was fighting off all contenders at the top spot, and stayed in the Top 3 for an incredible 21 weeks. It was perhaps no surprise, then, that Keira was on producer Jerry Bruckheimer\'s wanted list for the part of \"Guinevere\" in a planned accurate telling of the legend of \"King Arthur\". Filming took place in Ireland and Wales from June to November 2003. In July, Keira had become the celebrity face of British jeweller and luxury goods retailer, Asprey. At a photoshoot for the company on Long Island New York in August, Keira met and fell in love with Northern Irish model Jamie Dornan. King Arthur (2004) was released in July 2004 to lukewarm reviews. It seems audiences wanted the legend after all, and not necessarily the truth. Keira became the breakout star and \'one to watch in 2004\' throughout the world\'s media at the end of 2003.Keira\'s 2004 started off in Scotland and Canada filming John Maybury\'s time-travelling thriller Пiджак (2005) with Oscar-winner Adrien Brody. A planned movie of Deborah Moggach\'s novel, \"Tulip Fever\", about forbidden love in 17th Century Amsterdam, was canceled in February after the British government suddenly closed tax loopholes which allowed filmmakers to claw back a large proportion of their expenditure. Due to star Keira and Jude Law in the main roles, the film remains mothballed. Instead, Keira spent her time wisely, visiting Ethiopia on behalf of the \"Comic Relief\" charity, and spending summer at various grandiose locations around the UK filming what promises to be a faithful adaptation of Jane Austen\'s classic novel Гордiсть та упередження (2005), alongside Matthew Macfadyen as \"Mr. Darcy\", and with Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench in supporting roles. In October 2004, Keira received her first major accolade, the Hollywood Film Award for Best Breakthrough Actor - Female, and readers of Empire Magazine voted her the Sexiet Movie Star Ever. The remainder of 2004 saw Keira once again trying a completely new genre, this time the part-fact, part-fiction life story of model turned bounty hunter Domino (2005). 2005 started with the premiere of The Jacket (2005) at the Sundance Film Festival, with the US premiere in LA on February 28th. Much of the year was then spent in the Caribbean filming both sequels to Pirates Of The Caribbean. Keira\'s first major presenting role came in a late-night bed-in comedy clip show for Comic Relief with presenter Johnny Vaughan. In late July, promotions started for the September release of Pride & Prejudice (2005), with British fans annoyed to learn that the US version would end with a post-marriage kiss, but the European version would not. Nevertheless, when the movie opened in September on both sides of the Atlantic, Keira received her greatest praise thus far in her career, amid much talk of awards. It spent three weeks at No. 1 in the UK box office.Domino (2005) opened well in October, overshadowed by the death of Domino Harvey earlier in the year. Keira received Variety\'s Personality Of The Year Award in November, topped the following month by her first Golden Globe nomination, for Pride & Prejudice (2005). KeiraWeb.com exclusively announced that Keira would play Helene Joncour in an adaptation of Alessandro Baricco\'s novella Silk (2007). Pride & Prejudice (2005) garnered six BAFTA nominations at the start of 2006, but not Best Actress for Keira, a fact which paled soon after by the announcement she had received her first Academy Award nomination, the third youngest Best Actress Oscar hopeful. A controversial nude Vanity Fair cover of Keira and Scarlett Johansson kept the press busy up till the Oscars, with Reese Witherspoon taking home the gold man in the Best Actress category, although Keira\'s Vera Wang dress got more media attention. Keira spent early summer in Europe filming Silk (2007) opposite Michael Pitt, and the rest of the summer in the UK filming Atonement (2007), in which she plays Cecilia Tallis, and promoting the new Pirates movie (her Ellen Degeneres interview became one of the year\'s Top 10 \'viral downloads\'). Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man\'s Chest (2006) broke many box office records when it opens worldwide in July, becoming the third biggest movie ever by early September. Keira sued British newspaper The Daily Mail in early 2007 after her image in a bikini accompanied an article about a woman who blamed slim celebrities for the death of her daughter from anorexia. The case was settled and Keira matched the settlement damages and donated the total amount to an eating disorder charity. Keira filmed a movie about the life of Dylan Thomas, The Edge Of Love (2008) with a screenplay written by her mother Sharman Macdonald. Her co-star Lindsay Lohan pulled out just a week before filming began, and was replaced by Sienna Miller.What was announced to be Keira\'s final Pirates movie in the franchise, Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World\'s End (2007), opened strongly in June, rising to all-time fifth biggest movie by July. Atonement (2007) opened the Venice Film Festival in August, and opened worldwide in September, again to superb reviews for Keira. Meanwhile, Silk (2007) opened in September on very few screens and disappeared without a trace.

He was raised in a Catholic household. During his early years, Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, a truck driver, an assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary\'s Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players\' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \"The Risen People\". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin\'s Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Екскалiбур (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role.Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including Заколот на Баунтi (1984), A Woman of Substance (1984), The Mission (1986), and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in The Good Mother (1988) and High Spirits (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Людина пiтьми (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Under Suspicion (1991) and Ethan Frome (1993), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen\'s Husbands and Wives (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Список Шиндлера (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \"Anna Christie\", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Майкл Коллiнз (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood\'s top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Зорянi вiйни: Епiзод 1 - Прихована загроза (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan\'s Бетмен: Початок (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in Хронiки Нарнii: Лев, чаклунка i чарiвна шафа (2005).Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Викрадена (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Битва титанiв (2010) and Команда А (2010), and returned to the action genre with Невiдомий (2011), Сiрий (2011), Морський бiй (2012) and Викрадена 2 (2012), as well as the sequel Гнiв титанiв (2012).Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 Queen\'s New Year\'s Honours List for his services to drama.

During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played her best known role, Rachel Zane, on the legal drama series Suits. As an outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website, The Tig, featured a column profiling influential women. Her humanitarian work in the 2010s saw her represent international charity organizations. She has also received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She consequently retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements on behalf of the British royal family. Following their wedding on May 19, 2018, Markle became known as the Duchess of Sussex.Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California, at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park. Her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor, as of 2017 lives in View Park Windsor Hills, California. Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother. Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children. Markle\'s parents divorced when she was six years old. She has two older paternal half siblings, Thomas Markle Jr. and Samantha Markle, from whom she is reportedly estranged.Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her \"dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I\'m half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I\'m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed race woman.\"Markle grew up in Hollywood. She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse. At age 11, her successful campaign to get a company to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News. Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles, but was raised as a Protestant. She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, and participated in community service and charity projects. Markle graduated from Northwestern\'s School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor\'s degree and a double major in theater and international studies. She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between early acting jobs. Her first appearance on screen was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital. Early in her career, Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006). She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a \"briefcase girl\" on the US game show Deal or No Deal. She appeared in Fox\'s series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season. Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: \"Being \'ethnically ambiguous\', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role. Sadly, it didn\'t matter: I wasn\'t black enough for the black roles and I wasn\'t white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn\'t book a job.\"In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017. According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and actively repositioned her character from ingenue to moral conscience and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African American father is in a position to help her career and advance her strong desire to break several racial and gender \"glass ceilings\". She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.

After high school graduation, Geena entered New England College in New Hampshire and then transferred the next year to Boston University, where she majored in drama. In 1977, she graduated and moved to New York to start her career. Her career consisted of sales clerk and waitress. She worked at Ann Taylor, where she eventually rose to Saturday window mannequin while trying to get a job with a modeling agency. Eventually signed by the Zoli Agency, she wound up as a model in the Victoria Secret\'s Catalogue. Ever vigilant, Sydney Pollack was looking for new talent in the catalog when he spotted Geena and cast her in Тутсi (1982). With good reviews, Geena moved to Los Angeles where she was cast as Wendy in the short-lived but critically acclaimed television series Buffalo Bill (1983) with Dabney Coleman. A starter marriage to restaurant manager Richard Emmolo dissolved around this time. Her next appearance on television was in her own series Sara (1985), which was also good, but soon canceled. Geena then returned to the big screen in the below-average Transylvania 6-5000 (1985) followed by the successful Chevy Chase movie Fletch (1985). From there on, she was on a roll with second husband Jeff Goldblum in the horror remake Муха (1986). More successful were Tim Burton\'s dark comedy Бiтлджюс (1988) and The Accidental Tourist (1988).

More fun movies followed with the flying-saucer-in-the-pool Earth Girls Are Easy (1988) and everyone-loves-a-clown Quick Change (1990) with Bill Murray. The very successful Тельма i Луiiза (1991), directed by Ridley Scott, again garnered Academy Award nominations for Geena and Susan Sarandon. Iiхня власна лiга (1992), with Tom Hanks and directed by Penny Marshall, was the turning point as her next film, Hero (1992), was only average.

Undeterred, Renny decided to film the big-budget Cutthroat Island (1995), starring Geena as pirate leader Morgan, which also flopped.

She moved to Los Angeles and split her time between auditions and food service day jobs, eventually scoring a guest appearance as a waitress on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990). That performance led to more walk-on parts in shows like NYPD Blue (1993), Швидка допомога (1994), and Секретнi матерiали (1993). In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student on Rhea Perlman\'s ephemeral sitcom Pearl (1996).Liu first appeared on the big screen as an ex-girlfriend in Джерi Магуайер (1996) (she had previously filmed a scene in the indie Bang (1995), but it was shelved for two years). She then waded through a series of supporting parts in small films before landing her big break on Ally McBeal (1997). Liu initially auditioned for the role of Nelle Porter, which went to Portia de Rossi, but writer-producer David E. Kelley was so impressed with her that he promised to write a part for her in an upcoming episode. The part turned out to be that of growling, ill-tempered lawyer Ling Woo, which Liu filled with such aplomb that she was signed on as a regular cast member.The \"Ally\" win gave Liu\'s film career a much-needed boost--in 1999, she was cast as a dominatrix in the Mel Gibson action flick Розплата (1999), and as a hitchhiker in the ill-received boxing saga Play It to the Bone (1999). The next year brought even larger roles: first as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in Jackie Chan\'s western Шанхайський полудень (2000), then as one-third of the comely crime-fighting trio in Янголи Чарлi (2000).When she\'s not hissing at clients or throwing well-coiffed punches, Liu keeps busy with an eclectic mix of off-screen hobbies. She practices the martial art of Kali-Eskrima-Silat (knife-and-stick fighting), skis, rock climbs, rides horses, and plays the accordion. In 1993 she exhibited a collection of multimedia art pieces at the Cast Iron Gallery in SoHo (New York), after which she won a grant to study and create art in China. Her hectic schedule doesn\'t leave much time for romantic intrigue, but Liu says she prefers to keep that side of her life uncluttered.'),(394,'Matthew Goode','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzY2NjE0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDkxMDY0._V1_UY317_CR4,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1978-04-03','Matthew William Goode (born 3 April 1978) is an English actor.

She was the baby of the family with two older sisters (Virginia and Dottie) and an older brother, Richard, Jr. She was raised in an exclusive society town, Mountain Brook, Alabama. Courteney was the archetypal daddy\'s girl, and therefore was understandably devastated when, in 1974, her parents divorced, and her father moved to Florida.She became a rebellious teen, and did not make things easy for her mother, and new stepfather, New York businessman Hunter Copeland. Now, she is great friends with both. She attended Mountain Brook High School, where she was a cheerleader, tennis player and swimmer. In her final year, she received her first taste of modeling. She appeared in an advert for the store, Parisians. Upon graduation, she left Alabama to study architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College. After one year she dropped out to a pursue a modeling career in New York, after being signed by the prestigious Ford Modelling Agency. She appeared on the covers of teen magazines such as Tiger Beat and Little Miss, plus numerous romance novels. She then moved on to commercials for Maybeline, Noxema, New York Telephone Company and Tampax.While modeling, she attended acting classes, as her real dream and ambition was to be an actress. In 1984, she landed herself a small part in one episode of As the World Turns (1956) as a young débutante named Bunny. Her first big break, however, was being cast by Brian De Palma in the Bruce Springsteen video \"Dancing in The Dark\". In 1985, she moved to LA to star alongside Dean Paul Martin in Misfits of Science (1985). It was a flop, but a few years later, she was chosen out of thousands of hopefuls to play Michael J. Fox\'s girlfriend, psychology major Lauren Miller in Family Ties (1982).In 1989, Family Ties (1982) ended, and Cox went through a lean spell in her career, featuring in unmemorable movies such as Mr. Destiny (1990) with Michael Caine. Fortunes changed dramatically for Cox, when in 1994, she starred alongside Jim Carrey in the unexpected hit Ейс Вентура: Детектив з розшуку домашнiх тварин (1994), and a year later she was cast as Monica Geller on the hugely successful sitcom Друзi (1994). It was this part that turned her into an international superstar and led to an American Comedy Award nomination. In 1996 Cox starred in Wes Craven\'s horror/comedy Крик (1996) . This movie grossed over $100 million at the box office, and won Cox rave reviews for her standout performance as the wickedly bitchy and smug TV reporter Gale Weathers. She went on to play this character again in each of the three sequels. Not only did her involvement in this movie lead to critical acclaim, but it also led to her meeting actor husband David Arquette. He played her on-screen love interest Dewey, and life imitated art as the two fell in love for real. Their wedding took place in San Francisco, at the historic Grace Cathedral atop Nob Hill, on June 12th, 1999.

Her sister, Sophie Thompson, is an actor as well. Her father was English-born and her mother is Scottish-born. Thompson\'s wit was cultivated by a cheerful, clever, creative family atmosphere, and she was a popular and successful student. She attended Cambridge University, studying English Literature, and was part of the university\'s Footlights Group, the famous group where, previously, many of the Monty Python members had first met.Thompson graduated in 1980 and embarked on her career in entertainment, beginning with stints on BBC radio and touring with comedy shows. She soon got her first major break in television, on the comedy skit program Alfresco (1983), writing and performing along with her fellow Footlights Group alums Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. She also worked on other TV comedy review programs in the mid-1980s, occasionally with some of her fellow Footlights alums, and often with actor Robbie Coltrane.Thompson found herself collaborating again with Fry in 1985, this time in his stage adaptation of the play \"Me and My Girl\" in London\'s West End, in which she had a leading role, playing Sally Smith. The show was a success and she received favorable reviews, and the strength of her performance led to her casting as the lead in the BBC television miniseries Fortunes of War (1987), in which Thompson and her co-star, Kenneth Branagh, play an English ex-patriate couple living in Eastern Europe as the Second World War erupts. Thompson won a BAFTA Award for her work on the program. She married Branagh in 1989, continued to work with him professionally, and formed a production company with him. In the late 80s and early 90s, she starred in a string of well-received and successful television and film productions, most notably her lead role in the Merchant-Ivory production of Говардс Енд (1992), which confirmed her ability to carry a movie on both sides of the Atlantic and appropriately showered her with trans-Atlantic honors - both an Oscar and a BAFTA award.Since then, Thompson has continued to move effortlessly between the art film world and mainstream Hollywood, though even her Hollywood roles tend to be in more up-market productions. She continues to work on television as well, but is generally very selective about which roles she takes. She writes for the screen as well, such as the screenplay for Ang Lee\'s Розум i почуття (1995), in which she also starred as Elinor Dashwood, and the teleplay adaptation of Margaret Edson\'s acclaimed play Wit (2001), in which she also starred.Thompson is known for her sophisticated, skillful, though her critics say somewhat mannered, performances, and of course for her arch wit, which she is unafraid to point at herself - she is a fearless self-satirist. Thompson and Branagh divorced in 1994, and Thompson is now married to fellow actor Greg Wise, who had played Willoughby in Ang Lee\'s Розум i почуття (1995).

Hollywood also took brief notice when she was cast as the second lead femme in MGM\'s Conspirator (1949) (1949), starring Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Taylor.The stress and struggles of advancing her career coupled with a divorce from her first husband, Bill Sankey, caused Blackman to suffer a nervous collapse in the mid-1950s. After a brief time recovering in a hospital, she regained her health and began rebuilding her career with rather obligatory B-level fare, at first. That reentry culminated with a costarring role in one of the more famous retellings of the tragic \"Titanic\" tale, A Night to Remember (1958) (1958), costarring Kenneth More and David McCallum. Developing a solid footing again, she filmed Мiстер Пiткiн в тилу ворога (1958) (1959) with comedian Norman Wisdom and A Matter of WHO (1961) (1961) with Terry-Thomas.TV series work then also came her way, notably with the highly popular The Avengers (1961), costarring Patrick Macnee as John Steed. As the leather-clad \"Mrs. Cathy Gale\", Blackman showcased her incredible beauty, self-confidence, and athletic derring-do. Her admirable qualities made her not only a catch for the men, but also an inspirational figure for the 1960s feminist movement. Blackman left the show at its peak, however, and was replaced by the equally assertive and popular Diana Rigg as \"Mrs. Emma Peel\".Not out of work long, Blackman took on the role of Greek goddess \"Hera\" in popular movie adventure Jason and the Argonauts (1963) (1963) with marvelous Ray Harryhausen and melodrama Life at the Top (1965) (1965) with Laurence Harvey. She then filmed the most popular role of her career: \"Pussy Galore\". In the classic \"James Bond\" movie 007: Голдфiнгер (1964) (1964), Blackman went toe to toe with Sean Connery\'s womanizing \"007\" and created major sparks on screen, managing to outclass the (wink-wink) double meaning of her character\'s name.That resurgence of popularity should have led to better film opportunities but did not. Blackman toiled for the most part in low-level melodramas and routine adventures. She earned raves on stage, however, as the blind heroine of the thriller \"Wait Until Dark\" as well as for her dual roles in \"Mr. and Mrs.\", a production based on two of Noël Coward\'s plays. She also enjoyed working occasionally with her second husband, actor Maurice Kaufmann, in the play \"Move Over, Mrs. Markham\" and the film thriller Fright (1971) with Susan George. On stage, she became a throaty-voiced sensation in various musicals, such as \"A Little Night Music\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"On Your Toes\", and \"Nunsense\".Divorced from Kaufmann in 1975 (he died in 1997), Blackman never remarried. The couple adopted two children in the late 1960s, Lottie and Barnaby. Now an octogenarian, the ever-lovely and still glamorous star performs frequently, more recently working in the long-running English hit comedy series The Upper Hand (1990) and in her one-woman stage show, \"Wayward Ladies\".'),(425,'Brendan Fraser','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MjExMzY0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMxOTg4MTI@._V1_UY317_CR12,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1968-12-03','Brendan James Fraser was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Canadian parents Carol Mary (Genereux), a sales counselor, and Peter Fraser, a journalist and travel executive.

He started as a member of the Los Angeles comedy/improvisation group The Groundlings, where fellow cast members Ana Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and former Saturday Night Live (1975) repertory players such as Laraine Newman, Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman began their careers.

Her father is of German/Swiss-German and Irish descent, and her mother is of German ancestry. A short time after her birth, the family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where Katherine was to spend the majority of her childhood; the youngest member of her family, Katherine--or \"Katie\" as she is nicknamed--has two elder siblings, John and Meg. Tragically, her older brother Jason died in 1986 of brain injuries suffered in a car accident, after being thrown from the back of a pickup truck. When doctors determined he was brain-dead, the family made the difficult decision to donate his organs. Not only did this painful chapter give Katherine a greater perspective and appreciation for life, but it motivated her to use her celebrity to promote the importance of organ donation.Katherine was first thrust into the limelight as a child model. An aunt, visiting the family in New Canaan, took a number of photographs of Katherine, then aged nine, in a series of poses to advertise a hair care product she had invented. Upon returning to New York, with permission from Katherine\'s parents, she sent the photos to a number of modeling agencies. Within a few weeks, Katherine had been signed to Wilhelmina, a renowned international modeling agency. Almost immediately, she made her debut in a magazine advertisement and soon followed this with an inaugural television appearance in a national commercial for Cheerios breakfast cereal.Following a number of commercials and modeling assignments for Sears and Lord & Taylor, she made her big-screen debut in That Night (1992), which starred Juliette Lewis and C. Thomas Howell. It was then that she realized that acting rather than modeling was her passion. In 1993, Katherine appeared in Steven Soderbergh\'s critically-acclaimed Depression-era drama, King of the Hill (1993), before landing her first leading role as a rebellious teenager, alongside Gérard Depardieu, in My Father the Hero (1994). During this time, Katherine continued to attend New Canaan High School, balancing her academic studies with work on films and modeling, which she undertook during holidays, vacations and weekends.In 1995, she played \"Sarah Ryback\", the niece of Steven Seagal\'s character, in В облозi 2. Територiя темряви (1995), which was her \"debut\" in the action film genre. Acting was now becoming a stronger focus for Katherine, although she still modeled extensively, appearing regularly in magazines such as \"Seventeen\". Television appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) and Late Night with Conan O\'Brien (1993) soon followed, before she took the lead role in Disney\'s Wish Upon a Star (1996) in 1996. It was also during that year that Katherine\'s parents divorced and, following her graduation from high school in 1997, she moved with her mother into a four-bedroom house in Los Angeles\' Malibu Canyon area. This enabled her to focus upon acting with the guidance and support of her mother, who now managed her career.In 1997, Katherine portrayed \"Taffy Entwhistle\", Rita Hayworth\'s stand-in, in Stand-ins (1997) and was also cast as the beauteous \"Princess Ilene\" in the European production, Prince Valiant (1997). She then made her made-for-TV movie debut, co-starring with Peter Fonda in a re-working of the classic Shakespearean play, The Tempest (1998), updated with an American Civil War theme. In this film, she played \"Miranda Prosper\", a young woman torn between her love for both her father and a Union soldier. Bug Buster (1998) and Bride of Chucky (1998) represented a venture into the horror genre for Katherine. While both films could be described as rather tongue-in-cheek despite their gory emphases, Bride of Chucky (1998) was the better received, both critically and commercially.In 1999, Katherine decided to branch out into series television when she accepted the role of the haughty, yet vulnerable, \"Isabel Evans\", on Roswell (1999), a show that blended teen angst with sci-fi drama. Though she had never planned to embark on a career in television, the role of Isabel, a teenager with a secret life, was an offer she found impossible to refuse. In the series, Isabel, her brother Max (Jason Behr) and their friend Michael (Brendan Fehr) are aliens passing as humans in Roswell, New Mexico, as they desperately try to hide the truth from government agencies, the people of Roswell and even their own adopted families. To publicize her role on the show, Katherine graced the covers of magazines such as \"TV Guide\", \"Maxim\" and \"Teen\" and was interviewed on Later with Greg Kinnear (1994) and The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn (1999). Along with her mother Nancy, she also appeared in an episode of the Sci-Fi TV talk show, Crossing Over with John Edward (1999), during which she spoke with John Edward, a psychic medium, about her late brother, Jason. During the three years Roswell (1999) was in production, Katherine found time to work on several movies. 100 дiвчат i одна в лiфтi (2000), an independent film released in 2001, is the story of a college freshman who meets the girl of his dreams in an elevator during a blackout, and spends the rest of the movie trying to find her again. Her cameo role is that of Arlene, the competitive tomboy. The second film, Valentine (2001), a horror film starring David Boreanaz and Denise Richards, appeared in U.S. theaters on February 2, 2001. In this movie, which is based upon the 1996 novel by Tom Savage, Katherine plays \"Shelley\", a medical student who meets a sudden demise.In the spring of 2001, Katherine accepted a role in NBC\'s Critical Assembly (2002), a two-hour original television thriller. Katherine and Kerr Smith (Затока Доусона (1998)) co-starred as brilliant and politically concerned college students who build a nuclear device to illustrate the need for a change in national priorities, but are betrayed by a fellow student when the bomb ends up in the hands of a terrorist. Unfortunately, the telefilm, directed by Eric Laneuville, written by Tom Vaughan, and based on the best-seller \"The Seventh Power\" by James Mills, was shelved when its storyline was deemed too close for comfort to the events of September 11, 2001. It was eventually broadcast in 2003. Since the cancellation of Roswell (1999) in the spring of 2002, Katherine has been busy with various projects, including an appearance on UPN\'s update of the classic television series, The Twilight Zone (2002). That episode, entitled The Twilight Zone: Cradle of Darkness (2002), aired on October 2, 2002, and featured Katherine in the role of a woman who goes back in time to stop one of the most notorious murders in history. In addition, she completed a movie, Descendant (2003), a psychological thriller inspired by Edgar Allan Poe\'s \"The Fall of the House of Usher\". She has also starred as \"Romy\" in ABC/Touchstone\'s two-hour telepic, Romy and Michele: In the Beginning (2005), a prequel to the 1997 feature, Romy and Michele\'s High School Reunion (1997). During the summer of 2002, Katherine made a major decision in the direction of her career when she signed on for representation in all areas with the William Morris Agency, one of the biggest and most prestigious agencies in the entertainment industry. She is now being represented by Norman Aladjem at Paradigm Agency and being managed by Nancy Heigl and Stephanie Simon and Jason Newman at Untitled Entertainment.'),(430,'Jared Leto','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjUwNDUzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA4OTAzMTE@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1971-12-26','Jared Leto is a very familiar face in recent film history. Although he has always been the lead vocals, rhythm guitar, and songwriter for American band Thirty Seconds to Mars, Leto is an accomplished actor merited by the numerous, challenging projects he has taken in his life. He is known to be selective about his film roles.Jared Leto was born in Bossier City, Louisiana, to Constance \"Connie\" (Metrejon) and Anthony L. \"Tony\" Bryant. The surname \"Leto\" is from his stepfather. His ancestry includes English, Cajun (French), as well as Irish, German, and Scottish. Jared and his family traveled across the United States throughout his childhood, living in such states as Wyoming, Virginia and Colorado. Leto would continue this trend when he initially dropped a study of painting at Philadelphia\'s University of the Arts in favor of a focus on acting at the School of Visual Arts in New York City.In 1992, Leto moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career, intending to take acting roles on the side. Leto\'s first appearances on screen were guest appearances on the short-lived television shows Camp Wilder (1992), Almost Home (1993) and Rebel Highway (1994). However, his next role would change everything for Leto. While searching for film roles, he was cast in the show, Моe так зване життя (1994) (TV Series 1994-1995). Leto\'s character was \"Jordan Catalano\", the handsome, dyslexic slacker, the main love interest of \"Angela\" (played by Claire Danes). Leto contributed to the soundtrack of the film, and so impressed the producers initially that he was soon a regular on the show until its end.Elsewhere, Leto began taking film roles. His first theatrically released film was the ensemble piece, How to Make an American Quilt (1995), based on a novel of the same name and starring renowned actresses Winona Ryder, Anne Bancroft, Ellen Burstyn, Jean Simmons and Alfre Woodard. The film was a modest success and, while Leto\'s next film, The Last of the High Kings (1996), was a failure, Leto secured his first leading role in Prefontaine (1997), based on long-distance runner Steven Prefontaine. The film was a financial flop, but was praised by critics, notably Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. He also took a supporting role in the action thriller, Switchback (1997), which starred Dennis Quaid, but the film was another failure.Leto\'s work was slowly becoming recognized in Hollywood, and he continued to find work in film. In 1998, everything turned for the better on all fronts. This was the year that Leto founded the band, Thirty Seconds to Mars, with his brother, Shannon Leto, as well as Matt Wachter (who later left the group), and after two guitarists joined and quit, Tomo Milicevic was brought in as lead guitarist and keyboardist. As well as the formation of his now-famous band, Leto\'s luck in film was suddenly shooting for the better. He was cast as the lead in the horror film, Urban Legend (1998), which told a grisly tale of a murderer who kills his victims in the style of urban legends. The film was a massive success commercially, though critics mostly disliked the film. That same year, Leto also landed a supporting role in the film, Тонка червона лiнiя (1998). Renowned director Terrence Malick\'s first film in nearly twenty years, the film had dozens of famous actors in the cast, including Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas, to name a few. The film went through much editing, leaving several actors out of the final version, but Leto luckily remained in the film. Тонка червона лiнiя (1998) was nominated for seven Oscars and was a moderate success at the box office. Leto\'s fame had just begun. He had supporting roles in both James Mangold\'s Перерване життя (1999), and in David Fincher\'s cult classic, Бiйцiвський клуб (1999), dealing with masculinity, commercialism, fascism and insomnia. While Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were the lead roles, Leto took a supporting role and dyed his hair blond. The film remains hailed by many, but at the time, Leto was already pushing himself further into controversial films. He played a supporting role of \"Paul Allen\" in the infamous Американський психопат (2000), starring Christian Bale, and he played the lead role in Darren Aronofsky\'s Реквieм за мрieю (2000), which had Leto take grueling measures to prepare for his role as a heroin addict trying to put his plans to reality and escape the hell he is in. Both films were massive successes, if controversially received.The 2000s brought up new film opportunities for Leto. He reunited with David Fincher in Кiмната страху (2002), which was another success for Leto, as well as Oliver Stone\'s epic passion project, Alexander (2004). The theatrical cut was poorly received domestically (although it recouped its budget through DVD sales and international profit), and though a Final Cut was released that much improved the film in all aspects, it continues to be frowned upon by the majority of film goers. Leto rebounded with Збройний барон (2005), which starred Nicolas Cage as an arms dealer who ships weapons to war zones, with Leto playing his hapless but more moral-minded brother. The film was an astounding look at the arms industry, but was not a big financial success. Leto\'s flush of successes suddenly ran dry when he acted in the period piece, Lonely Hearts (2006), which had Leto playing \"Ray Fernandez\", one of the two infamous \"Lonely Hearts Killers\" in the 1940s. The film was a financial failure and only received mixed responses. Leto then underwent a massive weight gain to play \"Mark David Chapman\", infamous murderer of John Lennon, in the movie, Chapter 27 (2007). While Leto did a fantastic job embodying the behavior and speech patterns of Chapman, the film was a complete flop, and was a critical bomb to boot. It was during this period that Leto focused increasingly on his band, turning down such films as Clint Eastwood\'s World War 2 film, Прапори наших батькiв (2006).In 2009, however, Leto returned to acting with Мiстер Нiхто (2009). Leto\'s role as \"Nemo Nobody\" required him to play the character as far aged as 118, even as he undergoes a soul-searching as to whether his life turned out the way he wanted it to. The film was mostly funded through Belgian and French financiers, and was given limited release in only certain countries. Critical response, however, has praised the film\'s artistry and Leto\'s acting.He made his directorial debut in 2012 with the documentary film Artifact (2012).Leto remains the lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and main songwriter for Thirty Seconds to Mars. Their debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was released to positive reviews but only to limited success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005). Their following releases, This Is War (2009) and Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), received further critical and commercial success.After a five years hiatus from filming, Leto returned to act in the drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and co-starring Matthew McConaughey. Leto portrayed Rayon, a drug-addicted transgender woman with AIDS who befriends McConaughey\'s character Ron Woodroof. Leto\'s performance earned him an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor. In order to accurately portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body. He stated the portrayal was grounded in his meeting transgender people while researching the role. During filming, Leto refused to break character. Dallas Buyers Club received widespread critical acclaim and became a financial success, resulting in various accolades for Leto, who was awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role and a variety of film critics\' circle awards for the role.In 2016, he played the Joker in the super villain film Загiн самогубцiв (2016).Leto is considered to be a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. He often remains completely in character for the duration of the shooting schedules of his films, even to the point of adversely affecting his health.'),(431,'Jessica Camacho','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTEzYjY4MGYtN2U1OC00OTkyLTk4ZjUtODBhMzY4MDNiMjEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzMzk2Mjg@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1982-11-26','From the leader of a depression-era motorcycle gang, to a feared and skillful meta-human bounty hunter, and a monster-hunting FBI agent Jessica Camacho has brought dynamic female characters to life, showcasing her ability to illuminate their strong inner compass, unshakeable drive, and sheer determination.Camacho can next be seen starring in CBS\' highly anticipated, legal drama series, \"All Rise.\" Written and executive produced by Canadian writer Spottiswood and directed by Mike Robin, \"All Rise\" pulls back the curtain of a Los Angeles county court system, taking a deeper dive into the personal and professional lives of the judges, lawyers, clerks, bailiffs and cops.

Julie\'s father is a Pittsburgh surgeon and her mother is a figure ice skater. The family settled in nearby Murrysville, when Julie was two, and she started ice skating at age three. She competed in the 1988 U.S. Championships in junior ice dancing with her partner David Schilling, coming in 13th. Her older brother and sister, Jeffrey and Jennifer, were in the 1987 U.S. Junior Champions in ice dancing and competed internationally. When Julie was 14, she had a bad stress fracture and had to take time off.By 1989, with her figure skating career over, Julie turned to acting and got involved in the local theater where she got a role in the play \"Street Law\". Her first movie role was a small, credited, speaking part on in the Black Cat episode in the Dario Argento/George A. Romero co-direction horror flick, Due occhi diabolici (1990) playing in one scene alongside Harvey Keitel. A year later, she got a role on a TV show called Hi Honey, I\'m Home (1991).After graduating from high school, Julie entered New York University to study acting there. After graduation, Julie moved to Los Angeles to further pursue her career and landed some small roles in movies and TV shows including a guest appearance on Married with Children (1987) and in the Aaron Spelling TV pilot Crosstown Traffic (1995).In 1996, Julie auditioned for the role of \"Buffy\" in the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997), but lost out to Sarah Michelle Gellar.

The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result, she\'s built an eclectic resume that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica.Kate Elizabeth Winslet was born in Reading, Berkshire, into a family of thespians -- parents Roger Winslet and Sally Anne Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors, maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre, and uncle Robert Bridges was a fixture in London\'s West End theatre district. Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at eleven, dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids\' cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time, which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years, she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17, when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in Небеснi створiння (1994). The film, based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder, received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics.Still a relative unknown, Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for Ang Lee\'s Розум i почуття (1995). She made an immediate impression on the film\'s star, Emma Thompson, and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces, playing the rebellious heroine in Jude (1996) and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh\'s Гамлет (1996).The role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater, the passionate, rosy-cheeked aristocrat in James Cameron\'s Титанiк (1997). Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet, swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio and noting her refreshingly healthy, unemaciated physique. Winslet\'s performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination, making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations.After the swell of unexpected attention surrounding Титанiк (1997), Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both Закоханий Шекспiр (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) in order to play adventurous soul searchers in Hideous Kinky (1998) and Holy Smoke (1999). The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter, as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a \"deprogramming\" session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade\'s chambermaid and accomplice in Пiр\'я маркiза де Сада (2000). Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29). As of 2016, she has been nominated for an Oscar seven times, winning one of them: she received the Best Actress Oscar for the drama Читець (2008), playing a former concentration camp guard.For her performance of Joanna Hoffman in Стiв Джобс (2015), she received her seventh Academy Award nomination.Off camera, Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters, Anna Winslet and Beth Winslet (both actresses), and a brother, Joss.In 1998, she married assistant director Jim Threapleton. They had a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton, in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director Sam Mendes in 2003 and gave birth to their son, Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes, later that year. After seven years of marriage, in February 2010 they announced that they had amicably separated, and divorced in October 2010. In 2012, Kate married Ned Rocknroll, with whom she has a son. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Queen\'s Birthday Honours List for her services to drama.'),(435,'Simon Pegg','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwODE1NjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY5MzM2OTE@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1970-02-14','English actor, writer and comedian Simon Pegg was born Simon John Beckingham in Brockworth, Gloucestershire, to Gillian Rosemary (Smith), a civil servant, and John Henry Beckingham, a jazz musician.

This was followed by Michael Bay\'s action blockbuster Armageddon, starring alongside Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi, who would later go on to direct Liv in Lonesome Jim.Liv had come to the attention of director Robert Altman in Stealing Beauty and the late, great auteur went on to cast her in two of his final projects, Cookie\'s Fortune and Dr T and the Women, describing her as \"very serious, very prepared and very professional...I am crazy about her.\"In between her work for Altman, Liv starred opposite Ralph Fiennes in Onegin, directed by his sister Martha, from the classic novel by Alexander Pushkin. Ralph Fiennes said of Liv, \"We tested a lot of actresses but Liv has an acute sense of emotional truth that\'s not performed or projected, but just is.\"In 2001, Liv portrayed Arwen in the ground-breaking epic The Lord of the Rings trilogy: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King.Nothing if not eclectic, Liv then defied expectations by starring in cult director Kevin Smith\'s gentle low-budget comedy Jersey Girl, re-uniting her with her Armageddon co-star Ben Affleck, before playing Betty, the female lead to Edward Norton\'s Bruce Banner in Marvel\'s The Incredible Hulk.An actress who consistently refuses to be pigeonholed, Liv\'s career is one that cuts across genres; she cannot be defined by the roles she has chosen and is led, above all, by what speaks to her on an instinctual and emotional level. \"It\'s very difficult to say no to whatever comes along,\" Tom Hanks has said of her, \"...But she\'s saying no to all the right things.\"In addition to her acting work, Liv has forged a decade-long relationship with Givenchy as the spokesperson for their fragrance and cosmetics line. Liv is also a brand ambassador for Triumph lingerie, developing a capsule collection that celebrates the company\'s commitment to body confidence, as exemplified by Liv herself, \"a modern woman in every sense, a mother and actress with a fierce sense of femininity that women across the world can relate to.\"Liv\'s previous design collaboration was with Belstaff, resulting in two capsule collections for the iconic British heritage brand. Liv has also been the face of commercial campaigns for several global brands, including Visa and Pantene.'),(445,'Tommy Flanagan','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyODA3NjkyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI4ODIzMQ@@._V1_UY317_CR5,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1965-07-03','Tommy Flanagan was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland. In his twenties, Tommy made his living as a DJ for local dance clubs until a violent attack nearly ended his life. In hospital, his friend Robert Carlyle persuaded Tommy to give acting a try. Mr. Flanagan joined Carlyle\'s Raindog Theatre Company where he made his stage debut in such productions as \'Wasted I and II\', \'One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest\', and \'MacBeth\'.Tommy worked in various local and smaller film and television projects until he landed a small role in Mel Gibson\'s epic \'Braveheart\' in 1995. Mr. Gibson was so impressed that he expanded the role of rebel Morrison specifically for Tommy, exposing a worldwide audience to Mr. Flanagan.Following this, Tommy went on to work with an array of top directors in films such as Phillip Noyce\'s \'The Saint\', John Woo\'s \'Face/Off\', and David Fincher\'s \'The Game\'. In 1999, he would get the chance to once again work with Robert Carlyle in \'Plunkett and MacCleane\'.That same year, Tommy earned critical praise and numerous \'Best Actor\' nominations for his role as \'Da\', the troubled father in Lynne Ramsay\'s \'Ratcatcher\'. The film earned \'Best Director\' awards by many European film festivals including the London Film Critics Circle and the BAFTA 2000 awards.In 2000, Tommy displayed more facets as an actor, starring in Art Linson\'s \'Sunset Strip\' for director Adam Collis, where he played a mysterious 1970\'s hearth-throb, rock star.He then played the role of \'Cicero\', a faithful retainer of Russell Crowe\'s character in the Academy Award-winning \'Gladiator\' for director Ridley Scott. Tommy\'s focused and intense portrayal once again earned him praise and recognition.Tommy followed this up with roles in the indie features \'Dead Dogs Lie\' and \'Strictly Sinatra\', as well as the USA Network mini-series \'Attila\' opposite Gerard Butler, New Line\'s \'All About the Benjamins\' opposite Ice Cube, and \'Trauma\' opposite Colin Firth.In 2004, Tommy starred in 20th Century Fox\'s \'Alien vs. Predator\' for director Paul W.S. Anderson, and followed that up in 2005 with Miramax films \'Sin City\' for director Robert Rodriguez. And in 2006, Tommy played the pivotal role of the \'Stranger\' terrorizing Camilla Belle in Simon West\'s re-make of \'When a Stranger Calls\'. Tommy then played the enigmatic hit man \'Lazlo Soot\' in Joe Carnahan\'s \'Smokin\' Aces\'.In 2008, Tommy joined Charlie Hunnam, Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal in FX Network\'s drama, \'Sons of Anarchy\' (SOA), one of the highest rated shows for the network, running for seven seasons. A huge success with a devoted following, SOA was initially based upon Hamlet by creator / show-runner Kurt Sutter. Often criticized for graphic violence, SOA was snubbed by award panels despite praise by critics and viewers. Mr. Flanagan portrayed Filip \'Chibs\' Telford, a stalwart member of the, \"Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original\" (SAMCRO). Scottish by birth and raised in Belfast, Ireland, Chibs joined the IRA and the Belfast Chapter of Sons of Anarchy before events necessitated his transition to SAMCRO. The name Chibs refers to Scottish slang for a knife/ \"street knife\" (per Mr. Flanagan), a choice by Kurt Sutter referencing the real facial scarring Mr. Flanagan received in a near-fatal attack in his native Glasgow. Known as a \"Glasgow smile\" or \"Glasgow grin\" it is a highly distinctive regional form of violence and Sutter utilized it within the show. Mr. Flanagan himself is often questioned about his scarring and was quoted in Vulture 11/12/2014, \"I don\'t see the scars anymore. They\'re just ancient history now. It was a horrible thing that happened 20 years ago. I don\'t give it a second thought. It\'s just like a big wrinkle on my face.\" Tommy continues to create great roles in other hit series and films, gaining greater visibility and wider dramatic roles, including critically acclaimed UK drama \' Winter\' by Heidi Greensmith, in which he plays an emotionally tortured painter trying to keep his family together after the sudden loss of his wife. Among other notable roles, Mr. Flanagan stars in \'The Jesuit\' opposite Tim Roth and fellow Braveheart alum Brian Cox. In 2016 he adds \'Sand Castle, set during the Iraq War and \'Running Wild\' with Sharon Stone.'),(446,'Mackenzie Davis','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NTc2NDI4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc5NDE5OTE@._V1_UY317_CR51,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1987-04-01','Mackenzie Davis was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and went to McGill University in Montreal.

She was trained at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris and has appeared in such films as Loup (2009), Sleepless Night (2011) and Hacker\'s Game (2015). She plays the role of Mantis in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).Pom Klementieff was born in Quebec City, Canada, to a Korean mother and French-Russian father, who was working there as a consul with the French government. Her parents chose the name \"Pom\" because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both \"spring\" and \"tiger\". Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family traveled extensively due to her father\'s job. They lived in Japan and the Ivory Coast, before settling in France.Klementieff\'s father died of cancer when she was 5, and her mother had schizophrenia and was unable to care for children, so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt. Her uncle, whom she described as \"like [her] second father\", died on her 18th birthday, and her older brother committed suicide just seven years later, this time on her 25th birthday. Klementieff briefly attended law school after her uncle\'s death to appease her aunt but did not find the career path appealing. She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France. She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris. A few months into her education, she won a theater competition that awarded her free classes for two years with the school\'s top teachers.Klementieff\'s first professional acting job was the French independent film Après lui (2007), portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve. Filming for her scenes took three days. During one scene, Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself, and director Gaël Morel kept that shot in the final film. Her first leading role was in Loup (2009), a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains. During filming, Klementieff stayed in a camp, hours from the nearest village, where temperatures dropped well below zero. During filming she befriended nomads who lived there, worked with real wolves, rode reindeer, and swam with a horse in a lake.Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee\'s Oldboy (2013), a remake of the South Korean film of the same name. She portrayed Haeng-Bok, the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley. A fan of the original film, Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee, a producer with the remake, and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts. After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition, Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make-up, like her character in the film. She contributed some of her own clothes to the character\'s wardrobe, and trained three hours a day for two months for an on-screen fight with star Josh Brolin. Klementieff came up with the name Haeng-Bok, Korean for \"happiness\", herself after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character.Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions. She continued taekwondo after the film, and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014. Her next acting role was the film Hacker\'s Game (2015), in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film, and due to the movie\'s low budget, she had to do her own make-up and choose her own wardrobe. It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role, to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced. She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the role of Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and appeared in the same role in the film Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).'),(452,'Robin Wright','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTc4MzEyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY0ODkzMQ@@._V1_UY317_CR4,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1966-04-08','Robin Gayle Wright was born in Dallas, Texas, to Gayle (Gaston), a national director at Mary Kay, and Freddie Wright, a pharmaceutical executive.

His brother was actor Chris Penn. His father was from a Lithuanian Jewish/Russian Jewish family, and his mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent.Penn first appeared in roles as strong-headed or unruly youths such as the military cadet defending his academy against closure in Taps (1981), then as fast-talking surfer stoner Jeff Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982).Fans and critics were enthused about his obvious talent and he next contributed a stellar performance alongside Timothy Hutton in the Cold War spy thriller The Falcon and the Snowman (1985), followed by a teaming with icy Christopher Walken in the chilling At Close Range (1986). The youthful Sean then paired up with his then wife, pop diva Madonna in the woeful, and painful, Шанхайський сюрприз (1986), which was savaged by the critics, but Sean bounced back with a great job as a hot-headed young cop in Colors (1988), gave another searing performance as a US soldier in Vietnam committing atrocities in Жертви вiйни (1989) and appeared alongside Robert De Niro in the uneven comedy We\'re No Angels (1989). However, the 1990s was the decade in which Sean really got noticed by critics as a mature, versatile and accomplished actor, with a string of dynamic performances in first-class films.Almost unrecognisable with frizzy hair and thin rimmed glasses, Penn was simply brilliant as corrupt lawyer David Kleinfeld in the Brian De Palma gangster movie Шлях Карлiто (1993) and he was still in trouble with authority as a Death Row inmate pleading with a caring nun to save his life in Мертвий iде (1995), for which he received his first Oscar nomination. Sean then played the brother of wealthy Michael Douglas, involving him in a mind-snapping scheme in Гра (1997) and also landed the lead role of Sgt. Eddie Walsh in the star-studded anti-war film Тонка червона лiнiя (1998), before finishing the 1990s playing an offbeat jazz musician (and scoring another Oscar nomination) in Sweet and Lowdown (1999).The gifted and versatile Sean had also moved into directing, with the quirky but interesting The Indian Runner (1991), about two brothers with vastly opposing views on life, and in 1995 he directed Jack Nicholson in The Crossing Guard (1995). Both films received overall positive reviews from critics. Moving into the new century, Sean remained busy in front of the cameras with even more outstanding work: a mentally disabled father fighting for custody of his seven-year-old daughter (and receiving a third Oscar nomination) for Я - Сем (2001); an anguished father seeking revenge for his daughter\'s murder in the gut-wrenching Clint Eastwood-directed Таeмнича рiчка (2003) (for which he won the Oscar as Best Actor); a mortally ill college professor in 21 грам (2003) and a possessed businessman in The Assassination of Richard Nixon (2004).Certainly Sean Penn is one of Hollywood\'s most controversial, progressive and gifted actors.'),(455,'Maggie Grace','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU1NjM2YjMtZTUxMi00NWE2LWE1Y2UtZjI1NTM1YTA1NmY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MzUxMQ@@._V1_UY317_CR13,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1983-09-21','Maggie currently stars as \"Althea\" on the popular AMC series \"Fear the Walking Dead\".

Getting his start in television, including The Henderson Kids and the long running soap opera Neighbours, Mendelsohn broke out with his performance as an ill-fated juvenile delinquent in the acclaimed coming of age film The Year My Voice Broke. Mendelsohn won the best supporting actor award from the Australian Film Institute, his first of eight nominations.Mendelsohn went onto to become one of the most popular teen/young adult stars in Australia cinema, often rivaling other emerging talents of his generation, including Russell Crowe, Noah Taylor, and Guy Pearce, leading the Australian tabloid to nickname them \"the Mouse Pack\" in reference to the Rat Pack in America and Brit Pack in the UK, emerging at the same time. Among his peers, Mendelsohn seemed to corner the market on troubled, angry young men, thanks to his roles in Idiot Box, Metal Skin, and Nirvana Street Murder.

From there she started competing in several beauty pageants and, in 1987, she won the Miss Junior America pageant.She got her big break when she was cast as the popular cheerleader Kelly Kapowski on the NBC series Saved by the Bell (1989), which lasted for five years. But this was not at all the end of her career. Coinciding with the cancellation of the short-lived Saved by the Bell: The College Years (1993), she was cast as the bitchy, conniving vixen Valerie Malone on Aaron Spelling\'s long-running hit series Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990).

She was named after the character January Wayne in Jacqueline Susann\'s potboiler novel turned film, Once Is Not Enough (1975). She has two sisters, Jacey Jones and Jina Jones].Her family moved to the small town of Hecla, South Dakota, with a population of just some 400 souls in 1979, when she was one year old; they moved back to Sioux Falls in 1986. After graduating from Roosevelt High School, she moved to New York City to become a model. Despite her stature (5\'6\", which is short for a fashion model), she got modeling gigs, including Abercrombie & Fitch ads. However, modeling was just a means to an end, to get out of South Dakota and avoid going to college.She got her first taste of acting from TV commercials and found that she had flair for it, even though she did not act in high school and had no training. January appeared in a couple of television pilots and a cable television series before making her big screen debut in All the Rage (1999), an indie that never got a real release. She followed it up with a small role in the teen thriller Скляний будинок (2001). Her actual debut in the sense of attracting attention was in the near silent role of the beauty who entices Jane Fonda\'s son, Troy Garity, in the Bruce Willis-Cate Blanchett-Billy Bob Thornton comedy Бандити (2001). It was not a career-making part. At the time the movie was released, she was ending a three-year relationship with Ashton Kutcher.Small roles followed, including a \"don\'t blink or you won\'t see me\" part in the Adam Sandler-Jack Nicholson comedy Контроль над гнiвом (2003). She gained some career traction with a good role in another comedy, Американський пирiг 3: Весiлля (2003), a sequel to Американський пирiг (1999). Until she landed the part on Божевiльнi (2007), which made its debut on AMC in 2007, her career was steady but undistinguished. \"I choose roles that are not me\", January has said.

Through her father, she is the great-granddaughter of former Prime Minister Herbert H. Asquith, and her blue-blooded family tree also contains Barons and Baronesses, diplomats, and a director, Bonham Carter\'s great-uncle Anthony Asquith, who made Pygmalion (1938) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), among others. Cousin Crispin Bonham-Carter is also an actor. Her maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callejón, was a Spanish diplomat who was awarded the honorific Righteous Among the Nations, by Israel, for helping save Jews during World War II (Eduardo\'s own father was a Czech Jew). Helena\'s maternal grandmother, Hélène Fould-Springer, was from an upper-class Jewish family from France, Austria, and Germany, and later converted to her husband\'s Catholic faith.Bonham Carter experienced family dramas during her childhood, including her father\'s stroke - which left him wheelchair-bound. She attended South Hampstead High School and Westminster School in London, and subsequently devoted herself to an acting career. That trajectory actually began in 1979 when, at age thirteen, she entered a national poetry writing competition and used her second place winnings to place her photo in the casting directory \"Spotlight.\" She soon had her first agent and her first acting job, in a commercial, at age sixteen. She then landed a role in the made-for-TV movie A Pattern of Roses (1983), which subsequently led to her casting in the Merchant Ivory films Кiмната з видом (1985), director James Ivory\'s tasteful adaptation of E.M. Forster\'s novel, and Lady Jane (1986), giving a strong performance as the uncrowned Queen of England. She had roles in three other productions under the Merchant-Ivory banner (director Ivory, producer Ismail Merchant, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala): an uncredited appearance in Maurice (1987), and large roles in Where Angels Fear to Tread (1991) and Говардс Енд (1992).Often referred to as the \"corset queen\" or \"English rose\" because of her early work, Bonham Carter continued to surprise audiences with magnificent performances in a variety of roles from her more traditional corset-clad character in Крила голубки (1997) and Shakespearian damsels to the dark and neurotic anti-heroines of Бiйцiвський клуб (1999). Her acclaimed performance in Крила голубки (1997) earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination, a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination, a BAFTA Best Actress nomination, and a SAG Awards Best Actress nomination. It also won her a Best Actress Award from the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles Film Critics, the Boston Society Film Critics, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, the Texas Society of Film Critics, and the Southeastern Film Critics Association.In the late 1990s, Bonham Carter embarked on the next phase of her career, moving from capable actress to compelling star. Audiences and critics had long been enchanted by her delicate beauty, evocative of another time and place. Her late \'90s and early and mid 2000s roles included Mick Jackson\'s Live from Baghdad (2002), alongside Michael Keaton, receiving a nomination for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe; Paul Greengrass\' The Theory of Flight (1998), in which she played a victim of motor neurone disease; Trevor Nunn\'s Twelfth Night or What You Will (1996), in which she played Olivia; opposite Woody Allen in his Mighty Aphrodite (1995); Mort Ransen\'s Margaret\'s Museum (1995); Kenneth Branagh\'s Frankenstein (1994); and Franco Zeffirelli\'s Hamlet (1990).Other notable credits include her appearance with Steve Martin in Novocaine (2001), Tim Burton\'s remake of Planet of the Apes, in which she played an ape, Thaddeus O\'Sullivan\'s The Heart of Me (2002), opposite Paul Bettany, and Велика риба (2003), her second effort with Tim Burton, in which she appeared as a witch.In between her films, Helena has managed a few television appearances, which include her portrayal of Jacqui Jackson in Magnificent 7 (2005), the tale of a mother struggling to raise seven children - three daughters and four autistic boys; as Anne Boleyn in the two-parter biopic of Henry VIII starring Ray Winstone; and as Morgan Le Fey, alongside Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson, in Merlin. Earlier television appearances include Michael Mann\'s Полiцiя Маямi (1984) as Don Johnson\'s junkie fiancée, and as a stripper who wins Rik Mayall\'s heart in Dancing Queen (1993). Helena has also appeared on stage, in productions of Trelawney of the Wells, The Barber of Seville, House of Bernarda Alba, The Chalk Garden, and Woman in White.Bonham Carter was nominated for a Golden Globe for the fifth time for her role in partner Tim Burton\'s film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Суiннi Тодд: демон-перукар iз Флiт-стрiт (2007), for which Burton and co-star Johnny Depp were also nominated. For the role, she was awarded Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards 2008. Other 2000s work includes playing Mrs Bucket in Tim Burton\'s massive hit Чарлi та шоколадна фабрика (2005), providing the voices for the aristocratic Lady Campanula Tottington in Воллес i Громiт: Прокляття кролика-перевертня (2005) and for the eponymous dead heroine in Tim Burton\'s spooky Труп нареченоii (2005), and co-starring in Балачки з iншими жiнками (2005) opposite Aaron Eckhart.After their meeting while filming Планета Мавп (2001), Bonham Carter and Tim Burton made seven films together. They lived in adjoining residences in London, shared a connecting hallway, and have two children: Billy Ray Burton, born in 2003, and Nell Burton, who was born in 2007. Ironically, a mutual love of Sweeney Todd was part of the initial attraction for the pair.

She has the talent to become one of the major performers in the cinema of this young century.Samantha Morton was born on May 13, 1977 in Nottingham, England to parents who divorced when she was three years old. Peter and Pamela Morton took other spouses and made Samantha part of a mixed family of 13; she has eight brothers and sisters. She turned to play-acting early in her life, while she was a school-girl.At 13, she left regular school to train as an actress at the Central Junior Television Workshop, where she learned her craft for three years. It was at the end of her training then that she decided that a life as a professional actress was for her.She honed her skills in television roles, working her way up from series television to TV-movies and prestigious mini-series, such as Emma (1996) and Jane Eyre (1997). Her first major film role, Under the Skin (1997), won her the Best Actress Award from the Boston Film Critics Society. Woody Allen cast her as Hattie, the \"dumb\" (unspeaking) lover of Sean Penn\'s caddish jazz guitarist in Sweet and Lowdown (1999), a beautiful performance in a role that could have flummoxed a less-talented performer. Penn was Oscar-nominated for his performance, but it was Morton\'s Hattie that was central to the success of the film, Allen\'s last unqualified success. She provided the moral and narrative center of the film. It was quite a remarkable performance for a 21-year old as she had to do all her acting with her face, having been shorn of her voice. The role of Hattie won Morton a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination.Ironically, Morton had never seen a Woody Allen movie before. (She grew up watching the TV and listening to the radio.) She agreed to do the film after reading the script (as she says, well-written roles for women are hard to find), and the movie made her a hot commodity in Hollywood after she won the Oscar nomination. (She lost out to the ultra-hyped Angelina Jolie). Morton was offered many roles, but was very choosy as she was not in acting as a game with a payoff of stardom and money.She had consolidated her reputation by following up the Allen film with work in indie features that showed that she was not only talented, but quite courageous as a performer. She played a heroin addict in the underrated Jesus\' Son (1999) and gave a brilliant performance in Morvern Callar (2002), the story of a Scottish supermarket clerk coping with her boyfriend\'s suicide.Steven Spielberg cast her, opposite superstar Tom Cruise, as the clairvoyant in Особлива думка (2002), in which she more than held her own opposite Cruise and the special effects. (She took the role as Cruise and Speilberg are favorites of hers). As good as she was, Morton was better served by Irish director Jim Sheridan, Sheridan cast her as a character modeled after his wife in an autobiographical picture more in line with persona and that made better use of her talents. Her performance as the young Irish mother coping with life in New York City in В Америцi (2002) won her numerous critics\' awards and another Oscar nod, this time as Best Actress.At this point, one feels that the odds of her winning the Oscar are even or better. Samantha Morton continues to deliver fine work in provocative films such as Michael Winterbottom\'s Code 46 (2003), though she is branching out towards the mainstream, taking a role in the remake of that perennial family favorite, Лессi (2005).'),(509,'Luke Grimes','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkzNjBhMzgtYmQ3OC00N2JjLThhNWYtYTdlZjlhYzQ4ODIxL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ2ODg0Mw@@._V1_UY317_CR4,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1984-01-21','Luke Grimes was born on January 21, 1984 in Dayton, Ohio, USA as Luke Timothy Grimes.

It was at his sister\'s dance practices that he would stand outside the door and imitate the movements of the dancers inside. At age six, he was encouraged to step inside the door and, thus, his dance career began. His own story parallels that of Бiллi Еллiот (2000) in that Jamie kept his dancing a secret from his friends at school. His mother had him when she was 16 and, unfortunately, he never knew his father.When he met Stephen Daldry, director of Бiллi Еллiот (2000), Jamie adopted him as his father. Once the word about his dancing got out, he was harassed, but this only made him more determined to prove that dancing wasn\'t just for girls. He has proven a lot by landing the title role of Бiллi Еллiот (2000), winning the role in an audition that included more than 2,000 boys from the northeast of England.

She is the daughter of Kathleen Ann (Craft), a philanthropist, and Martin Joseph Holmes, Sr., a lawyer. She is of German, Irish, and English ancestry. Her parents have said that her strong-willed personality is probably from being born premature. Being the youngest in the Holmes clan, completing the family of three other sisters and one brother, Katie was always the baby.As a teenager, she began attending modeling school. When she was sixteen, her teacher invited her to go to a modeling competition with other girls from her class. She competed in the International Modeling and Talent Association by singing, dancing, and reciting a monologue from Вбити пересмiшника (1962). By the end of that time in New York, Katie won many awards. But she said she didn\'t want to model because it wasn\'t challenging enough. So when she was seventeen, Katie went to Los Angeles to audition for movies. Luckily, on her second audition, she was cast in the movie, Крижана буря (1997), directed by Ang Lee. Katie\'s character was Libbets Casey, a rich New Yorker, who is pursued by two of the main characters. It was a small part, but it marked the beginning of her professional acting career.After the excitement of her first movie, Katie began sending in audition tapes for pilot shows. During that time, she was also starring in her all-girls Catholic high school musical, Damn Yankees, as Lola. After Kevin Williamson received her audition tape for his new show, Затока Доусона (1998), the producers wanted her to come to Hollywood right away and read live for them. But because they wanted her to come on the opening night for Damn Yankees, Katie had to tell them she couldn\'t make it. Fortunately, the show\'s producers wanted her so much for that role, they rescheduled her callback and the result was she got the part as Joey Potter. During her first year with Затока Доусона (1998), Katie was able to do two movies, Disturbing Behavior (1998) and Вперед (1999), and, for the former, she won Best Breakthrough Female Performance in the 1999 MTV Movie Awards.The following year, she starred next to Michael Douglas in Wonder Boys (2000), playing Hannah Green, a published author and a boarder at her teacher\'s (Douglas) house, who has a crush on him, and tries to seduce him. Her first leading role came in 2002, with Abandon (2002). She played a college student named Katie Burke, who is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of her boyfriend who vanished two years prior. With Затока Доусона (1998) coming to a close after six years in May of 2003, it was a bittersweet thing for all the cast. Accustomed to being in North Carolina filming ten months out of a year, the cast members now had the opportunity to make more movies.Katie demonstrated this in October, when she had two new movies, Pieces of April (2003) and The Singing Detective (2003), coming out in that month alone. Pieces of April (2003) is a charming Thanksgiving movie about April (Holmes), the black sheep of her family, who wants to give her family the perfect dinner before her mother passes on. The Singing Detective (2003) is a dark musical where the main character (Robert Downey Jr.) is a writer in a hospital for skin conditions who writes a dark world of seduction and murder in his mind. Katie Holmes plays the kind Nurse Mills who tends to his every need. She also gets to lip sync and dance in this movie. In 2004, she starred in the romantic movie First Daughter (2004), in which she played the President\'s (Michael Keaton) daughter, Samantha, who wants to go to college without any Secret Service tagging along. In 2005, Holmes co-starred in Бетмен: Початок (2005), where she played Rachel Dawes, a childhood sweetheart and love interest to Batman/Bruce Wayne.'),(522,'Samantha Robinson','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgyOGE2YjYtY2I4Yy00YWFiLTg5ZjQtOThhYThmYWUxYTNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIyMjUyODI@._V1_UY317_CR14,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1991-10-19','Samantha Robinson was born in New York City to Panamanian and English parents.

Young Flynn was a rambunctious child who could be counted on to find trouble. Errol managed to have himself thrown out of every school he was enrolled in. In his late teens he set out to find gold, but instead found a series of short lived odd jobs. Information is sketchy, but the positions of police constable, sanitation engineer, treasure hunter, sheep castrator, shipmaster for hire, fisherman, and soldier seem to be among his more reputable career choices. Staying one jump ahead of the law and jealous husbands forced Flynn to England. He took up acting, a pastime he had previously stumbled into when asked to play (ironically) Fletcher Christian in a film called In the Wake of the Bounty (1933). Flynn\'s natural athletic talent and good looks attracted the attention of Warner Brothers and soon he was off to America. His luck held when he replaced Robert Donat in the title role of Captain Blood (1935). He quickly rocketed to stardom as the undisputed king of adventure films, a title inherited from Douglas Fairbanks, but which remains his to this day. Onscreen, he was the freedom loving rebel, a man of action who fought against injustice and won the hearts of damsels in the process. His off-screen passions; drinking, fighting, boating and sex, made his film escapades seem pale. His love life brought him considerable fame, three statutory rape trials, and a lasting memorial in the expression \"In like Flynn\". Serious roles eluded him, and as his lifestyle eroded his youthful good looks, his career declined. Troubles with lawsuits and the IRS plagued him at this time, eroding what little money he had saved. A few good roles did come his way late in life, however, usually aging alcoholics, almost mirror images of Flynn.

He started working in the film industry at the age of seven. In 1981, he was cast as Tyler in Steven Spielberg\'s E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Shortly thereafter, he nabbed the lead in Francis Ford Coppola\'s classic The Outsiders, starring opposite the likes of Diane Lane, Patrick Swayze, Matt Dillon, and Tom Cruise. It was Howell\'s gripping performance as the tough, yet vulnerable Ponyboy Curtis that made him a household name virtually overnight. Earmarked as an up-and-coming actor, Howell\'s career soon skyrocketed with roles in films including the comedy Grandview, U.S.A. (1984), alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, and the violent Cold War invasion drama Red Dawn (1984). His career was not helped by the controversial racial comedy Soul Man (1986), which was not well-received. However, he did meet and fall in love with his co-star from that movie, Rae Dawn Chong, whom he later married.Whilst superstardom has eluded him, there\'s no doubting that Howell has been in consistent demand with film producers.

Her maternal grandfather was Welsh. Her father died when Naomi was seven and she began to follow her mother and her brother around England, until she was fourteen, then they settled in Australia, where her maternal grandmother was from. She coaxed her mother into letting her take acting class when they arrived. After bit parts in commercials, she landed her first role in For Love Alone (1986). Naomi met her best friend, Nicole Kidman, when they both auditioned for a bikini commercial and they shared a taxi ride home. In 1991, Naomi starred along Kidman in the sleeper-hit Flirting (1991) directed by John Duigan. Naomi continued her career by starring in the Australian Brides of Christ (1991) co-starring Oscar-winners Russell Crowe and Brenda Fricker.In 1993, she worked with John Duigan again in Широке Саргасове море (1993) and director George Miller in Gross Misconduct (1993). Tank Girl (1995), in 1995, an adaptation of the comic book was a cult hit, starred Naomi as \"Jet Girl\", but it didn\'t fare well at the box-office and didn\'t do much for her career as a whole. Watts continued to take insignificant parts in movies including the much forgotten film Children of the Corn: The Gathering (1996). It wasn\'t until David Lynch cast her in the critically acclaimed film Малхолланд Драйв (2001) that she began to become noticed. Her part as an aspiring actress showed her strong acting ability and wide range and earned her much respect, as much as to say by some that she was overlooked for a Oscar nomination that year. Stardom finally came to Naomi in the surprise hit Дзвiнок (2002), which grossed over $100,000,000 at the box-office and starred Watts as an investigative reporter hunting down the truth behind several mysterious deaths seemingly caused by a video tape. While the movie did not fare well with the critics, it launched her into the spotlight. In 2003, she starred in Alejandro González Iñárritu\'s 21 грам (2003) which earned her - what some say is a much overdue Oscar nomination and brought others to call her one of the best in her generation of actors. The same year, she was nominated for 21 грам (2003), Naomi was chosen to play \"Ann Darrow\" in director Peter Jackson\'s Кiнг Конг (2005) which took her to New Zealand for a five month shoot. Watts completed her first comedy in Змова (2004) for director David O. Russell, playing a superficial spokes model - a break from her usual intense and dramatic roles she is known for.In 2005, she reprized her role as the protective-mother-reporter \"Rachel Keller\" in The Ring Two (2005). The movie, released in March, opened to $35,000,000 at the box office in the first weekend and established her as a box-office draw. Also in 2005, it was decided that her independent movie Ellie Parker (2001) would be re-released in late 2005 after its success at resurfacing at the Sundance Film Festival. The movie, which Naomi also produced, features her in the title role and is a bit biographical, but yet exaggerated take of the life of a struggling actress as she comes to Hollywood and encounters nightmares of the profession (it also features Watts\' own beat-up Honda which she travels around in). In 2006, she starred with Edward Norton in Розмальована вуаль (2006). In July of 2007, Naomi gave birth to a boy, Alexander Pete (Sasha Schreiber) in Los Angeles with Liev Schreiber. Since then her career choices have gathered even more critical acclaim with starring roles roles in German director Michael Haneke\'s American remake of his thriller Забавнi iгри (2007), David Cronenberg\'s Порок на експорт (2007), and the action-thriller, Iнтернацiональ (2009), released in February 2009.

His parents are teachers. He was educated at Tonbridge School and trained in acting at the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain. He studied English Literature at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Whilst he was a Cambridge undergraduate, he acted in several student drama productions. He played the title role in the Marlowe Dramatic Society\'s production of William Shakespeare\'s play, \"Macbeth\". This was staged at the Cambridge Arts Theatre from Tuesday 26th February to Saturday 2nd March 2002. The cast also featured Rebecca Hall in the roles of Lady Macbeth and Hecate. During one of his university summer holidays in August 2003 he went to Slovakia where he filmed his scenes for the Hallmark production of Frankenstein (2004). Dan played the part of Henry Clerval and the mini-series was first broadcast on American television on 5th October 2004. Shortly after graduating from Cambridge Dan was nominated for an Ian Charleson award for his performance as Orlando in \"As You Like It\" at the Rose Theatre at Kingston in Surrey. \"As You Like It\" was directed by Peter Hall and ran from 30th November to 18th December 2004. This production for the Peter Hall Company subsequently went on a tour of America in the early months of 2005, playing at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, the Curran Theater in San Francisco and the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City. It featured Rebecca Hall in the role of Rosalind.Dan was reunited with the director Peter Hall when he played Claudio in a new production of the Shakespeare play, \"Much Ado About Nothing\", for the Peter Hall Company at the Theatre Royal in Bath from 29th June to 6th August 2005. In February 2006 Dan played the parts of Marban and Maitland in a revival of Howard Brenton\'s controversial play, \"The Romans in Britain\", directed by Samuel West at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Then in May 2006 he played Nick Guest, the protagonist in The Line of Beauty (2006). This three part television mini-series was adapted by Andrew Davies from the 2004 Booker prize winning novel by Alan Hollinghurst. The Line of Beauty (2006) is about Nick Guest\'s relationship with his university friend Toby Fedden. The story takes place in the 1980s. It is set against the backdrop of Margaret Thatcher\'s free market economic policies and the spread of the acquired immunity deficiency syndrome, (AIDS). These two social developments directly affect the characters in the story because Toby\'s father Gerald is a Conservative member of parliament and Nick is homosexual.Whilst The Line of Beauty (2006) was being broadcast on BBC television, Dan was appearing as Simon Bliss in the Noël Coward play, \"Hay Fever\". This play was staged at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London from 11th April to 5th August 2006 and the cast also included Judi Dench in the role of Judith Bliss.

In 2007 Dan played the part of Michael Faber in Agatha Christie\'s Marple: Nemesis (2007), an Agatha Christie adaptation with Geraldine McEwan in the role of Miss Jane Marple. He also featured in the cast of Maxwell (2007), a television drama about the famous newspaper magnate. Maxwell (2007) was first broadcast on British television on 4th May 2007. David Suchet played Robert Maxwell, and Dan took the part of Basil Brookes, one of the press baron\'s financial directors.Dan played the part of Edward Ferrars in a television dramatization of Jane Austen\'s novel, Sense & Sensibility (2008). This was broadcast in three episodes on BBC1 between Tuesday 1st and Sunday 13th January 2008. The novel was adapted for television by Andrew Davies, whom Dan had previously worked with on The Line of Beauty (2006). Davies felt that the part of Edward Ferrars was underdeveloped in the book, and so he deliberately added scenes not included in the novel to help draw out the character. So, for instance, we saw Edward out horse riding on the Norland estate and chopping logs at Barton Cottage. In the DVD audio commentary Dan joked that this was the best example of log chopping ever seen on British television! After Sense & Sensibility (2008), Dan featured in the cast of \"The Tennis Court\", a BBC Radio 4 Saturday play broadcast on 19th January 2008. He also played Nicky Lancaster in a revival of the Noël Coward play, \"The Vortex\", at the Apollo Theatre in London from Wednesday 20th February to Saturday 7th June 2008.

Hayek has freely admitted that she and her brother, Sami, were spoiled rotten by her well-to-do businessman father, Sami Hayek Dominguez, and her opera-singing mother, Diana Jiménez Medina. Her father is of Lebanese descent and her mother is of Mexican/Spanish ancestry. After having seen Вiллi Вонка та шоколадна фабрика (1971) in a local movie theatre, Salma decided she wanted to become an actress. At 12, she was sent to the Academy of the Sacred Heart in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she pulled pranks on the nuns by setting their clocks back three hours. She was soon expelled. Only after attending Mexico City\'s Universidad Iberoamericana did she feel ready to pursue acting seriously.She soon landed the title role in Teresa (1989), a hugely successful soap opera which earned her the star status in her native Mexico. However, anxious to make films and to explore her talent and passion, Hayek left both Teresa (1989) and Mexico in 1991. Heartbroken fans spread rumors that she was having a secret affair with Mexico\'s president and left to escape his wife\'s wrath.At long last, Salma made her way to Los Angeles. The 24 year old actress approached Hollywood with naïve enthusiasm, and quickly learned that Latin actresses were, if at all, typecast as the mistress maid or local prostitute. By late 1992, Hayek had landed only bit parts. She appeared on Street Justice (1991), The Sinbad Show (1993), Nurses (1991), and as a sexy maid on the HBO series Dream On (1990). She also had one line in the Allison Anders film Mi vida loca (1993). Feeling under-appreciated by Anglo filmmakers, Hayek vented her frustrations on comedian Paul Rodriguez\'s late-night Spanish-language talk show in 1992.Robert Rodriguez and his producer wife Elizabeth Avellan happened to be watching and were immediately smitten with the intelligent, opinionated young woman. He soon gave her her big break--to star opposite Antonio Banderas in the now cult classic Десперадо (1995), which put her on Hollywood\'s map. The moviegoers proved to be as dazzled with Hayek as he had been. After her break, she was cast again by Rodriguez to star in his Вiд заходу до свiтанку (1996). Although her vampy role opposite George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino was a small one, it was a good credit to her box office name. Hayek\'s first star billing came later that year with Fools Rush In (1997) opposite Друзi (1994) actor Matthew Perry. The film was a modest hit, and Hayek continued to rise her star in both commercial and artistic films such as: Breaking Up (1997) with an unknown Russell Crowe; 54 (1998) about the rise and fall of the legendary New York club; Догма (1999), playing the muse in a somewhat odd comedy co-starring Matt Damon and Chris Rock; In the Time of the Butterflies (2001), the small artistic film which won Hayek an ALMA award as best actress; and the 1999 summer blockbuster Дикий, дикий Вест (1999). Her production company \"Ventanarosa\" produced the 1999 Mexican feature film Полковнику нiхто не пише (1999), which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival and selected as Mexico\'s official Oscar entry for best foreign film.The new millennium started out quietly around Salma as she was preparing to produce and star in her dream role, that of Frida Kahlo, the legendary Mexican painter whom Salma had been admiring her entire life and whose story she wanted to bring to the big screen ever since her arrival in Hollywood. It finally happened in 2002. Фрiда (2002), co-produced by Hayek, was a beautifully made film overflowing with passion and enthusiasm, with terrific performances from Salma and Alfred Molina as Kahlo\'s cheating husband \"Diego Rivera\". On the side was an entourage of stars including Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd, Geoffrey Rush, Edward Norton and Valeria Golino.The picture was a hit and was nominated for six Oscars, including best actress for Hayek, who became the first Latin actress to be nominated in the category, and won the awards for make-up and its brilliant original score by Elliot Goldenthal. Hayek established herself as the serious actress that she is and, in the same year, expanded her horizons, directing The Maldonado Miracle (2003), which was shown at the Sundance Film festival. In 2003, she starred in the final of Rodriguez\'s \"Desperado\" trilogy Якось у Мексицi (2003), again opposite Banderas, and has just finished Пiсля заходу сонця (2004) opposite Pierce Brosnan and Ask the Dust (2006) opposite Colin Farrell. Both are scheduled for release in early 2005.

The young Jackie was less than successful scholastically, so his father sent him back to Hong Kong to attend the rigorous China Drama Academy, one of the Peking Opera schools. Chan excelled at acrobatics, singing and martial arts and eventually became a member of the \"Seven Little Fortunes\" performing troupe and began lifelong friendships with fellow martial artists / actors Sammo Kam-Bo Hung and Biao Yuen. Chan journeyed back and forth to visit his parents and work in Canberra, but eventually he made his way back to Hong Kong as his permanent home. In the early 1970s Chan commenced his movie career and interestingly appeared in very minor roles in two films starring then rising martial arts superstar Bruce Lee: Шалений кулак (1972), aka \"Fist of Fury\" aka \"The Chinese Connection\", and the Warner Bros. production Вихiд Дракона (1973). Not long after Lee\'s untimely death Chan was often cast in films cashing in on the success of Bruce Lee by utilizing words like \"fist\", \"fury\" or \"dragon\" in their US release titles.Chan\'s own film career was off and running and he swiftly appeared in many low-budget martial arts films that were churned out at a rapid fire pace by Hong Kong studios eager to satisfy the early 1970s boom in martial-arts cinema. He starred in Shao Lin mu ren xiang (1976) (aka \"Shaolin Wooden Men\"), Jian hua yan yu jiang nan (1977) (aka \"To Kill With Intrigue\"), Трохи кунг-фу (1978) (aka \"Half A Loaf of Kung Fu\") and Fei du juan yun shan (1978) (aka \"Magnificent Bodyguards\"), which all fared reasonably well at the cinemas. However, he scored a major breakthrough with the hit П\'яний майстер (1978) (aka \"Drunken Master\"), which has become a cult favorite among martial arts film fans. Not too long after this, Chan made his directorial debut with Shi di chu ma (1980) (aka \"The Young Master\") and then \"Enter the Dragon\" producer Robert Clouse lured Jackie to the US for a film planned to break Jackie into the lucrative US market. Battle Creek Brawl (1980) (aka \"Battle Creek Brawl\") featured Jackie competing in a \"toughest Street fighter\" contest set in 1940s Texas; however, Jackie was unhappy with the end result, and it failed to fire with US audiences. In a further attempt to get his name known in the US, Jackie was cast alongside Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore and Dean Martin in the Hal Needham-directed car chase flick Перегони Гарматне ядро (1981). Regrettably, Jackie was cast as a Japanese race driver and his martial arts skills are only shown in one small sequence near the film\'s conclusion. Stateside success was still a few years away for Jackie Chan!Undeterred, he returned to the Orient to do what he did best--make jaw-dropping action films loaded with amazing stunt work. Chan and his legendary stunt team were unparalleled in their ability to execute the most incredible fight scenes and action sequences, and the next decade would see some of their best work. Chan paired with the dynamic Sammo Hung Kam-Bo to star in Qi mou miao ji: Wu fu xing (1983) (aka \"Winners & Sinners\"), Проект А (1983) (aka \"Project \"A\"), Закусочна на колесах (1984) (aka \"Wheels On Meals\"), Fuk sing go jiu (1985) (aka \"Winners & Sinners 2\"), Xia ri fu xing (1985) (aka \"My Lucky Stars 2\", aka \"Winners & Sinners 3\"(. Chan then journeyed back to the US for another shot at that market, starring alongside Danny Aiello in The Protector (1985),) filmed in Hong Kong and New York. However, as with previous attempts, Jackie felt the US director--in this case, James Glickenhaus--failed to understand his audience appeal and the film played to lukewarm reviews and box-office receipts. Jackie did, however, decide to \"harden\" up his on-screen image somewhat and his next film, Полiцейська iсторiя (1985) (aka \"Police Story\") was a definite departure from previously light-hearted martial arts fare, and his fans loved the final product!This was quickly followed up with the Iндiана Джонс: У пошуках втраченого ковчега (1981)-influenced Обладунки Бога (1986) (aka \"The Armour of God\"), during filming of which Jackie mistimed a leap from a wall to a tree on location in Yugoslavia and fell many quite a few feet onto his head, causing a skull fracture. It was another in a long line of injuries that Chan has suffered as a result of doing his own stunt work, and he was soon back in front of the cameras. Проект А 2 (1987) (aka \"Project A: Part 2\"), Полiцейська iсторiя 2 (1988) (aka \"Police Story 2\"), Мiстер Гонконг (1989) (aka \"Mr. Canton and Lady Rose)\", Обладунки Бога 2 (1991) (aka \"Armour of God 2\") and Полiцейська iсторiя 3: Суперкоп (1992) (aka \"Police Story 3\") were all sizable hits for Jackie, escalating his status to phenomenal heights in Asia, and to his loyal fan base around the globe. US success was now just around the corner for the the hard-working Jackie Chan, and it arrived in the form of the action film Розбiрки в Бронксi (1995) (aka \"Rumble In The Bronx\", though it was actually filmed in Canada) that successfully blended humor and action to make a winning formula in US theaters.Jackie did not waste any time and went to work on Перший удар (1996) (aka \"Police Story 4\"), Мiстер Крутий (1997) (aka \"Mr. Nice Guy\"), Хто я? (1998) (aka \"Who Am I\"), which all met with positive results at the international box office. Jackie then went to work in the his biggest-budget US production, starring alongside fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker in the action / comedy Година пiк (1998). The film was a bigger hit than \"Rumble In the Bronx\" and firmly established Jackie as a bona fide star in the US. Jackie then paired up with rising talent Owen Wilson to star in Шанхайський полудень (2000) and its sequel, Шанхайськi лицарi (2003), and re-teamed with Tucker in Година пiк 2 (2001), as well as starring in Смокiнг (2002), Медальйон (2003) and the delightful Навколо свiту за 80 днiв (2004). Not one to forget his loyal fan base, Jackie returned to more gritty and traditional fare with Нова полiцейська iсторiя (2004) (aka \"New Police Story\") and Мiф (2005) (aka \"The Myth\"). The multi-talented Chan (he\'s also a major recording star in Asia) shows no sign of slowing down and has long since moved out of the shadow of Bruce Lee, to whom he was usually compared early in his career.Chan is truly one of the international film industry\'s true maverick actor / director / stuntman / producer combinations - he has done it the hard way, and always his way to achieve his dreams and goals to be an international cinematic star. Off screen he has been directly involved in many philanthropic ventures providing financial assistance to schools and universities around the world. He is a UNICEF GoodWill Ambassador, and he has campaigned against animal abuse and pollution and assisted with disaster relief efforts to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami victims.'),(546,'Malin Akerman','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4ODAwMjIwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI2NDA2OA@@._V1_UY317_CR50,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1978-05-12','Malin was born in Stockholm, Sweden and raised in Toronto, Canada.

Her mother, Marina Alyabysheva, divorced her father, Konstantin Kurylenko, soon after her birth. After the divorce her mother struggled to survive as an art teacher. Young Olga was brought up by her mother and her grandmother, Raisa. During her youth Olga had the humbling experience of living in poverty; she had no choice but to wear rags and had to darn the holes on her sweater. During her years in Ukraine she studied art and languages and spent seven years studying piano at a local school of music in Berdyansk. She also went to a ballet studio until 13.At age 13 Olga and her mother made a trip to Moscow. There she was spotted by an agent, who approached her at a subway station and offered her a job as a model.

Just remarkable\". In addition to Засудження (2010), Lewis also makes a cameo in Todd Phillips\' comedy, Встигнути до (2010), starring Robert Downey Jr., Michelle Monaghan and Zach Galifianakis.Beginning in 2004, Juliette took a hiatus from acting to embark on a musical journey.

He has a younger brother, Mark Welling, who is also an actor, and two older sisters. He is of three quarters German and one quarter British Isles (mostly Irish) descent. Welling graduated from Okemos High School in Okemos, Michigan, when he was eighteen years old. Before that, he spent his freshman year in the Salesianum School in Wilmington, Delaware. He played a lot of varsity soccer in his high school and received \"fair\" grades on his exams. But even so, Tom did not want to go to college. He wanted to be a construction worker and after graduation worked in a construction service site.Tom eventually moved on to modeling after spending a period of time working in the construction business. While modeling, he met fellow celebrity and model Ashton Kutcher while they were booked for a project together. The two eventually become good friends. Even though both Ashton and Tom were famous models, Tom decided to be an actor. He had an offer from a guy who worked in the agency he was signed with to be an actor. Tom attended a few casting calls and not too long later, became an actor.The acting gigs that he received eventually made directors take more notice of him. Tom Welling was asked to play the role of Clark Kent in the hit series Smallville (2001). What many people probably don\'t know is that Tom turned down the role twice. He said that the reason he turned down the role wasn\'t because the story wasn\'t good, but it was because he thought the role was bigger than he was and he didn\'t want people to think that he wasn\'t a good enough actor.Even so, Tom ended up taking the role because he had the feeling that the show was going to be a great hit and he would be a fool not to take it. Tom even said he felt some sort of connection between himself and his character, Clark Kent. Therefore, Tom made himself a household name.Other than only becoming a face on television, Welling also acts in other movies. The movie with which he is probably most associated is Оптом дешевше (2003), in which he starred with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, and its sequel, Оптом дешевше 2 (2005), in which he repeated his prior role. Tom has also starred in a B-grade horror flick, The Fog (2005), together with Загубленi (2004)\'s star, Maggie Grace. Although that movie didn\'t really achieve box-office success, Tom\'s acting talents still got noticed by the critics. More recently, he co-starred in the fictional historical drama Паркленд (2013) with Zac Efron, whom he befriended.Tom married Jamie White, one of his closest friends, on July 5, 2002. Tom has said that the person he respects the most is his wife, because she has the greatest heart.

He moved with his parents, younger brother and sister to London, England, at the age of seven. Ray always wanted to be in the movies, and be like their heroes. He also began to nurture a love for martial arts from the age of seven, when his father\'s fondness for Bruce Lee films sparked a fire in the youngster\'s mind that would never extinguish. Specializing in the traditional Chinese Northern Shaolin Kung-fu (in the Chin Woo style), Park moved on to master other styles, most notably Wushu. In 1991, at age 16, Ray became a member of the Great Britain Wushu team, competing in his first international in Beijing, China at the 1st World Wushu Championships. Ray was the first Wushu athlete from Great Britain and Europe to place in the top seven in the world, and went on to compete for Great Britain for another six years. He became a fixture at martial arts exhibitions and tournaments, Nationally, European and Internationally, attaining Gold Medal for the Great Britain Wushu and the Chin Woo Martial Arts team.Ray began teaching himself gymnastics at a young age but felt he was missing the correct training to achieve a higher level. At fifteen, he found a school that was willing to allow him to practice and use the floor space. The gymnastic training helped to improve his martial arts training and began to sit in and take seminars in coaching gymnastics. It was when he was nineteen that he relocated to another gymnastic gym and became one of the boys\' squad coaches. He further went on to be in charge of coaching recreational gymnastics throughout schools in London. Ray\'s boys squad won 1st in The London Youth Games for Hendon Gymnastics Club. During one of his frequent visits to Malaysia, he was approached to audition for Мортал Комбат: Винищення (1997). Ray became martial arts advisor to one of the stunt coordinators and later landed playing one of the Reptiles, Baraka, and doubling for Rayden.Conjuring memories of his youthful cinematic martial arts passion, Park attempted to learn as much as possible about the process of filmmaking. Soon being given more scenes and becoming more natural on set, he was contacted by stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to audition for George Lucas\' prequel Зорянi вiйни: Епiзод 1 - Прихована загроза (1999).

Emmy\'s performance in the latter film gained her a Golden Globe nomination.Emmanuelle Grey Rossum was born in New York City, where she was raised by her single mother, Cheryl Rossum, a corporate photographer (she has only met her father a few times). Her mother is of Russian Jewish descent and her father has English and Dutch ancestry. After passing an audition at the Metropolitan Opera when she was 7 years old, Rossum performed in more than 20 operas in six different languages at Lincoln Center, alongside such figures as Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. She was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in \"Carmen.\" She left the opera when she entered her teenage years, as she had grown too tall to perform as a child. Emmy also appeared in a Carnegie Hall presentation of \"The Damnation of Faust.\" She graduated from the Spence School, a private institution in Manhattan, in 1996 and then earned a high school diploma when 15 years old by taking online extension courses offered by Stanford University (Education Program for Gifted Youth). She later enrolled at Columbia University and studied art history and French.In a change of venue, Emmy created the role of Abigail Williams in the daytime soap opera As the World Turns (1956) in 1997 and branched out in performances in the made-for-television movies Genius (1999) and Iсторiя Одрi Гепберн (2000), in which she played the title character as a young teenager. Other television work included Snoops (1999), Law & Order (1990), and The Practice (1997).Emmy made her theatrical feature debut in the indie film Songcatcher (2000), with her good friend Rhoda Griffis, which won the Special Jury Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2000. Rossum received an Independent Spirit Award nomination in the category of Best Debut Performance for her performance as an Appalachian orphan. She played an aspiring songwriter (the title character) in the romantic comedy Nola (2003). Cast as the ill-fated daughter of a small-business owner in Clint Eastwood\'s Таeмнича рiчка (2003), she projected an aura of innocence that made her character\'s tragic death memorable and heartbreaking. This was her first major studio film.After six months of filming her role as the fresh-faced but highly intelligent teenage damsel in distress Пiслязавтра (2004) in Montreal, she returned to New York and screen-tested for the role of Christine in Привид опери (2004) in full costume and makeup, and was finally selected for the part by Andrew Lloyd Webber after singing for him at his home. Although she was surprised to be chosen ahead of many better-known and older actresses considered for the part, the combination of her vulnerable, fragile beauty and fine, classically trained singing voice ultimately proved that she was perfectly cast. In preparation for the role, she took ballet classes for two months and started polishing her singing. Emmy has commented that, in her approach to acting, she draws heavily upon her own experiences, so she visited locations in Paris and conjured up what she terms \"past memories\" to draw upon in making her performance emotionally realistic. She stood on the roof of the Opéra Garnier, where Christine sings \"All I Ask of You,\" and went underneath the opera house, where there is actually a gloomy, dark lake. She studied Degas\'s paintings of ballerinas in the Musée d\'Orsay to learn how to stand like one.Her next project Посейдон (2006) was a mainstream effort, but since its release, she has been more true to advice she obtained from Sean Penn when making Таeмнича рiчка (2003), that she should be picky and only accept roles that are fun to do, such as Перлини дракона: Еволюцiя (2009).'),(560,'Henry Fonda','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEwNjQ2ODQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEwMTM2._V1_UY317_CR20,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Henry Jaynes Fonda was born in Grand Island, Nebraska, to Elma Herberta (Jaynes) and William Brace Fonda, who worked in advertising and printing.

By the mid-1970s, young Ian was landing spots in national commercials at the age of 12, which led to roles in various soap operas and stage plays, most notably The Guiding Light (1952), the Broadway production of I Remember Mama and, in a national touring production of Peter Pan. In 1981 he made his feature film debut in Endless Love (1981) (as Brooke Shields\'s little brother) - a film that also marked the big-screen debuts of Tom Cruise and James Spader.However, in 1990, Ziering landed the role that would change his life - \'Steve Sanders\' on the teen drama, Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990). The show brought instant, worldwide fame to the cast. Ian was suddenly an international heartthrob and played the role for the show\'s entire ten-year run. During his years on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990) he was also featured in various films and television shows, including Russell Crowe\'s No Way Back (1995), What I Like About You (2002) and Melrose Place (1992), to name a few.Since Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990), Ziering has appeared on numerous television shows including CSI: NY (2004), JAG (1995) and Fran Drescher\'s Happily Divorced (2011). In addition, he has continued to be one of the most in-demand actors for various animated films and television shows including Spider-Man (2003), Mighty Ducks (1996), Batman Beyond (1999) and Biker Mice from Mars (1993). In 2005, in a real change of pace from his normal acting roles, Ziering also appeared in the Tony Scott feature film thriller, Domino (2005), with Keira Knightley. Other film credits include National Lampoon\'s: The Legend of Awesomest Maximus (2011), Мiй пацан (2012) with Adam Sandler, An American Girl: McKenna Shoots for the Stars (2012) with Nia Vardalos, Snake & Mongoose (2013), and, Christmas in Palm Springs (2014).In 2007, Ziering showed the world that he was a true triple threat when he signed on to the fourth season of the hit ABC series, Dancing with the Stars (2005).

In addition to his ongoing acting roles and voice over work, Ian is a much sought-after television host and, was most recently seen hosting HGTV\'s A-List Pets.2013 proved to be a pivotal year for Ziering both professionally and personally. At the age of 49, Ian became a Las Vegas headliner when he starred as the celebrity guest host of the award-winning production of Chippendales at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino. Taking on this new role, the actor hit the gym and dropped 30 pounds, transforming himself into a fit and muscled man, thrilling the sold-out audiences. His Chippendales engagement brought him a new wave of fans and international acclaim, thrusting him once again into the limelight. The engagement was such a huge success, establishing Ian as a major Las Vegas box-office draw, he was asked to return to the show in Summer 2014 for another sold-out run at the Rio with the world-famous brand.However, it was during his final week with the Chippendales in 2013 that Ian\'s small-budget film Sharknado (2013) aired on the SyFy Channel and instantly became a social media and worldwide phenomenon. Garnering more than 5,000 Tweets per minute during its initial broadcast - more than any other television show to date - Sharknado (2013) became an instant science fiction, cult classic and, even received a theatrical release in movie theatres around the world due to its popularity with fans.The franchise exploded so much that in July 2014 Ian reprised his role as Fin Shepard in SyFy\'s Sharknado 2: The Second One (2014), and the film went on to devour the world and become an even bigger pop culture phenomenon than the first. The record-setting sequel had nearly 4 million viewers in its first broadcast and went on to claim the title as the \"Most social movie on TV ever\" by garnering one billion (that is NOT a typo) Twitter impressions.

Jennifer is the middle of three musically-inclined sisters, Leslie Scholl, a homemaker, and Lynda Lopez, who is a DJ on New York\'s WKTU, a VH1 VJ, and a morning news show correspondent on New York\'s Channel 11.Jennifer always dreamed of being a multi-tasking superstar. As a child, she enjoyed a variety of musical genres, mainly Afro-Caribbean rhythms like salsa, merengue and bachata, and mainstream music like pop, hip-hop and R&B. Although she loved music, the film industry also intrigued her. Her biggest influence was the Rita Moreno musical, Вестсайдська iсторiя (1961). At age five, Jennifer began taking singing and dancing lessons. Aside from being a budding entertainer, Jennifer was also a Catholic schoolgirl, attending eight years at an all-girls catholic high school named \"Holy Family,\" located in the Bronx, before graduating from Preston High School after a four-year stay. At school, Jennifer was an amazing athlete and participated in track and field and tennis. At age eighteen, Lopez moved out of her parent\'s home.

Serkis earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for his portrayal of serial killer Ian Brady in the British television film Longford (2006), and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for his portrayal of new wave and punk rock musician Ian Dury in the biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll (2010). In 2015, he had a small role in Месники: Ера Альтрона (2015). Serkis has his own motion capture workshop, The Imaginarium Studios in London, which he will use for his directorial debut, Мауглi (2018).Andrew Clement G. Serkis was born April 20, 1964, in Ruislip Manor, West London, England. He has three sisters and a brother. His father, Clement Serkis, an ethnic Armenian whose original family surname was Serkissian, was a medical doctor working abroad, in Iraq; the Serkis family spent time around the Middle East, and for the first ten years of his life, Andy traveled between Baghdad and London. His mother, Lylie (Weech), who is British-born, was busy working as a special education teacher of handicapped children, so Andy and his four siblings were raised with au pairs in the house. Young Serkis wanted to be an artist; he was fond of painting and drawing, and visualized himself working behind the scenes. He attended St. Benedict\'s School, a Roman Catholic School for boys at the Benedictine Abbey in London. Serkis studied visual arts at Lancaster University in the north-west of England. There, he became involved in mechanical aspects of the theatre and did stage design and set building for theatrical productions. Then, Serkis was asked to play a role in a student production, and made his stage debut in Barrie Keeffe\'s play, \"Gotcha\"; thereafter, he switched from stage design to acting, which was a real calling that transformed his life.Instead of going to an acting college, Serkis, in 1985, began his professional acting career at the Duke\'s Playhouse in Lancaster, where he was given an Equity card and performed in fourteen plays, one after another, as an apprentice of Jonathan Petherbridge. After that, he worked in touring theatre companies, doing it for no money, fueled by a sense of enthusiasm, moving to a new town every week. He has thus appeared in a host of popular plays and on almost every renowned British stage. In 1989, he appeared in a stage production of William Shakespeare\'s \"Macbeth\", so beginning his long association with the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, where he would return many times, to appear in \"She Stoops to Conquer\", \"Your Home in the West\" and the \"True Nature of Love\", among other plays. In the 1990s, Serkis began to make his mark on the London stage, appearing at the Royal Court Theatre as \"The Fool\" in \"King Lear\", making his interpretation of \"The Fool\" as the woman that \"Lear\", a widower, could relate to - a man, in drag, as a Victorian musician. He also appeared as \"Potts\" in the hit play, \"Mojo\", playing in front of full houses and earning huge critical success. In 1987, Serkis made his debut on television, and he acted in several major British TV miniseries throughout the 1990s.In 1999, Andy Serkis landed the prize role of \"Gollum\" in Peter Jackson\'s epic film trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien\'s saga, \"The Lord of the Rings\". He spent four years in the part and received awards and nominations for his performance as \"Gollum\", a computer-generated character in Володар перснiв: Повернення короля (2003), which won 11 Oscars. \"Gollum\" was the collaborative team\'s effort around Serkis\'s work in performance capture - an art form based on CGI-assisted acting. Serkis\'s work was an interactive performance in a skin-tight CGI suit with markers allowing cameras to track and register 3D position for each marker. Serkis\' every nuance was picked up by several cameras positioned at precisely calculated angles to allow for the software to see enough information to process the image. The images of Serkis\' performances were translated into the digital format by animators at Weta Digital studio in New Zealand. There, his image was key-frame animated and then edited into the movie, Serkis did have one scene in \"The Return of the King\" showing how he originally had the ring, killing another hobbit to posses it after they found it during a fishing trip. He drew from his three cats clearing fur balls out of their throats to develop the constricted voice he produced for \"Gollum\" and \"Sméagol\", and it was also enhanced by sound editing in post-production.Serkis spent almost two years in New Zealand and away from his family, and much of 2002 and 2003 in post-production studios for large periods of time, due to complexity of the creative process of bringing the character of \"Gollum\" to the screen. Serkis had to shoot two versions for every scene; one version was with him on camera, acting with (chiefly) Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, which served both to show Wood and Astin the moves so that they could precisely interact with the movements of \"Gollum\", and to provide the CGI artists the subtleties of Gollum\'s physical movements and facial expressions for their manual finishing of the animated images. In the other version, he\'d go the voice off-camera, as Wood and Astin repeated their movements as though \"Gollum\" were there with them; that take would be the basis for inserting the CGI Gollum used in the released movie. In post-production, Serkis was doing motion-capture wearing a skintight motion capture suit with CGI gear while acting as a virtual puppeteer redoing every single scene in the studio. Additional CGI rotomation was done by animators using the human eye instead of the computer to capture the subtleties of Serkis\' performance. Serkis also used this art form in his performance as \"Kong\" in Кiнг Конг (2005), which won him a Toronto Film Critics Association Award (2005) for his unprecedented work helping to realize the main character in \"King Kong\", and a Visual Effects Society Award (2006) for Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Motion Picture.Apart from his line of CGI-driven characters, Serkis continued with traditional acting in several leading and supporting roles, such as his appearances as \"Richard Kneeland\" opposite Jennifer Garner in 13 Going on 30 (2004), and \"Alley\" opposite David Bowie in Престиж (2006), among other film performances. On television, he starred as \'Vincent Van Gogh\' in the sixth episode of Simon Schama\'s Power of Art (2006), the BBC2 series about artists. Serkis is billed as \"Capricorn\" in the upcoming adventure film, Inkheart (2008). At the same time, he continued the development of performance capture while expanding his career into computer games. He starred as \"King Bothan\" in the martial arts drama, Heavenly Sword (2007), a Playstation 3 title, for which he provided a basis for his in-game face and also acts as a dramatic director on the project.Andy Serkis married actress and singer Lorraine Ashbourne, and the couple have three children: daughter Ruby Serkis (born in 1998), and two sons Sonny Serkis (born in 2000) and Louis Ashbourne Serkis (born on 19 June 2004), who is now also a movie star. Away from acting, Andy Serkis is an accomplished amateur painter. Since his school years at Lancaster, being so close to the Lake District, Serkis developed his other passion in life: mountaineering. He is a pescetarian. Serkis has been active in charitable causes, such as The Hope Foundation, which provides essential life-saving medical aid for children suffering from Leukemia and children from countries devastated by war. In October 2006, he was a presenter at the first annual British Academy Video Games Awards at the Roundhouse, London.

Some believed that such a career-defining role might leave him unable to escape it, but he proved the doubters wrong, becoming one of the most notable film actors of his generation, with a host of great movies to his name. This arguably culminated in his greatest acclaim in 1988, when Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an Irish cop in Недоторканнi (1987), stealing the thunder from the movie\'s principal star Kevin Costner. His film career also includes such films as Marnie (1964), Iм\'я троянди (1986), Лiга видатних джентльменiв (2003), Iндiана Джонс i останнiй хрестовий похiд (1989), Полювання на \'Червоний Жовтень\' (1990), Горянин (1986), Вбивство в Схiдному експресi (1974), DragonHeart (1996) and Скеля (1996). Connery has been polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland\'s Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted \"Sexiest Man of the Century\".Thomas Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland. His mother, Euphemia McBain (née McLean), was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He has a brother, Neil Connery, who works as a plasterer in Edinburgh. He is of Irish and Scottish descent. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist\'s model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional footballer or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent moves.No Road Back (1957) was Sean\'s first major movie role, and it followed by several Tv-movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) and guest appearances on TV-series, and also films such as Hell Drivers (1957), Another Time, Another Place (1958), Darby O\'Gill and the Little People (1959), The Frightened City (1961). In 1962 he appeared in Найдовший день (1962) with a host of other stars.Connery\'s breakthrough came in the role of secret agent James Bond. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit. He played the character in the first five Bond films: 007: Доктор Ноу (1962), 007: З Росii з любов\'ю (1963), 007: Голдфiнгер (1964), 007: Кульова блискавка (1965), and 007: Живеш тiльки двiчi (1967) - then appeared again as Bond in 007: Дiаманти залишаються назавжди (1971) and Нiколи не кажи нiколи (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Connery\'s selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer \"Cubby\" Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Connery was the right man. James Bond\'s creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery\'s casting, saying, \"He\'s not what I envisioned of James Bond looks\", and \"I\'m looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man,\" adding that Connery (muscular, 6\' 2\", and a Scot) was unrefined. Fleming\'s girlfriend told him that Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful 007: Доктор Ноу (1962) premiere. He was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for Bond in the later novels. Connery\'s portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that, \"Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat.\" The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male sex symbols of film. During the filming of 007: Кульова блискавка (1965), Connery\'s life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Emilio Largo\'s pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but, despite this, it was not a fixed structure and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately. Connery was forced to wear a toupee during each of the Bond movies because he had started balding at the age of 17. This didn\'t prevent Connery from being cast in roles, although it became more noticeable in his later years. In 2005, From Russia with Love was adapted by Electronic Arts into a video game, titled James Bond 007: From Russia with Love (2005), which featured all-new voice work by Connery as well as his likeness, and those of several of the film\'s supporting cast.After and during the success of the Bond-films he has maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock\'s Marnie (1964), The Hill (1965), Вбивство в Схiдному експресi (1974), Людина, що хотiла стати королем (1975), The Wind and the Lion (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Горянин (1986), Iм\'я троянди (1986), Недоторканнi (1987) (which earned him an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role), Iндiана Джонс i останнiй хрестовий похiд (1989), Полювання на \'Червоний Жовтень\' (1990), Rising Sun (1993), Скеля (1996), Знайти Форрестера (2000), and Лiга видатних джентльменiв (2003).Sean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had a son, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963, he followed in his father\'s footsteps and also became an actor. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they have stayed married, they have no children together. He is also a grandfather.

Rebecca attended Berkeley High School where her nickname was the \"Jolly Blond Giant\", then she attended the University of California at Santa Cruz where she majored in Music, but left in 1995.She was a natural for modeling, and has posed for Sports Illustrated, Christian Dior and Victoria\'s Secret, to name but a few. Rebecca first met John Stamos in 1994, at a Victoria\'s Secret Fashion Show and had her first date with him at Disneyland. They married in September 1998, but have since gotten divorced.Rebecca\'s favorite foods are fillet mignon, tuna sashimi and Häagen-Dazs Cappuccino Commotion ice cream. But to keep her weight at a svelte 130 pounds, she stays fit with a rigorous stretching and strengthening routine (her firm body tone is evident when compared to photos of her earlier modeling, where she was very slim but not toned). Rebecca\'s most famous movie role, so far, was as the shapeshifting Mystique in Люди Iкс (2000), based on the long-running comic book series about teenage mutant superheroes (that Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created in 1962). To play Mystique every day, Rebecca had to start out nude, and then two female makeup artists would apply blue body paint and other stick-on parts for 8 hours a day. Rebecca told Jay Leno on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) that things like tissue paper would stick to her hips; and, one day, the long hours of wearing sticky paint makeup made her so upset that director Bryan Singer told her to have a glass of white wine and relax. Notwithstanding those technical difficulties, Люди Iкс (2000) was a box-office bonanza, and Rebecca\'s future in films was assured.'),(568,'Jena Malone','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NDM5OTE0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMzNjM0Nw@@._V1_UY317_CR21,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1984-11-21','Jena Malone was born in Sparks, Nevada, to Deborah Malone and Edward Berge. Her grandfather owned a casino, Karl\'s Silver Club, in Sparks. She was raised by her mother and her mother\'s partner. Beginning as a child actress, and then stepping up to roles as a young adult, Malone\'s career path has been compared to that of Jodie Foster, herself a former child actress and who has co-starred with Malone in two movies. Jena is often described as having a maturity beyond her years and, in her career thus far, she has often tackled roles that are difficult and are not standard fare for actors her age.Malone\'s first claim to fame was in performing the title role in Bastard Out of Carolina (1996) for which she won the Young Artist Award, and which she filmed when she was merely ten years old. This movie dealt with issues of child abuse, violence and sex. Jena has said in later interviews that this movie and her participation in it continue to influence her life substantially.Showing self-assurance and a clear vision of personal goals from an early age, Jena, at age 14, was encouraged to try out for Лiтак президента (1997), a movie that was virtually guaranteed to be a success since box-office king Harrison Ford was cast in the lead, but Jena said she\'d prefer to seek other roles that were of more interest to her.In the following years, Malone appeared in several made-for-TV movies for which she won or was nominated for many awards. In 1997, she lucked in to being cast in the blockbuster Контакт (1997) where she portrayed the child version of Jodie Foster\'s lead character. Foster stated that she built her character by mimicking Jena. And, in 1998, Jena was cast in the major film Stepmom (1998) where she co-starred with Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris. Jena was given what was likely the best line in that movie where her character, bitter over her parents\' divorce, confronts her father who has returned home briefly; at a moment of crisis, her dad tells her \"You do NOT run out on your mother\", and the rueful Malone exclaims \"No -- that\'s YOUR job\".Also, in 1998, Malone appeared in a two-part episode of the critically acclaimed TV series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993). Contrary to what might usually be expected of a teenage actress, in this episode, Jena played the complex role of the perpetrator of a crime, which she portrayed with subtlety.At age 15, Jena was legally emancipated and thus took direct control of her finances and her career. Malone began getting more attention and acclaim in her next set of films: the artistic cult film Доннi Дарко (2001); the teenage journey The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (2002) where she again co-starred with Jodie Foster; and the satirical Saved! (2004) which debuted Jena as the lead in a movie.Jena has expressed an interest in directing some day, and so she is preparing for roles behind the camera as well as in front. In 2002, she co-produced American Girl (2002) while also starring in it. And, in 2003, she undertook a formal study of photography.In early 2006, Malone debuted on the Broadway stage in the play \"Doubt\".

His parents met in Norway. They wed and moved to New York, where Viggo, Jr. was born, before moving to South America, where Viggo, Sr. managed chicken farms and ranches in Venezuela and Argentina. Two more sons were born, Charles and Walter, before the marriage grew increasingly unhappy. When Viggo was seven, his parents sent him to a a strict boarding school, isolated in the foothills of the mountains of Argentina. Then, at age eleven, his parents divorced. His mother moved herself and the children back to her home state of New York.Viggo attended Watertown High School, and became a very good student and athlete. He graduated in 1976 and went on to St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. After graduation, he moved to Denmark - driven by the need for a defining purpose in life. He began writing poetry and short stories while working many odd jobs, from dock worker to flower seller. In 1982, he fell in love and followed his girlfriend back to New York City, hoping for a long romance and a writing career. He got neither. In New York, Viggo found work waiting tables and bar tending and began taking acting classes, studying with Warren Robertson. He appeared in several plays and movies, and eventually moved to Los Angeles, where his performance in \"Bent\" at the Coast Playhouse earned him a Drama-logue Critic\'s Award.He made his film debut with a small part in Свiдок (1985). He appeared in Salvation!: Have You Said Your Prayers Today? (1987) and married his co-star, Exene Cervenka. The two had a son, Henry Mortensen. But after nearly eleven years of marriage, the couple divorced.In 1999, Viggo got a phone call about a movie he did not know anything about: The Lord of the Rings. At first, he didn\'t want to do it, because it would mean time away from his son. But Henry, a big fan of the books, told his father he shouldn\'t turn down the role. Viggo accepted the part and immediately began work on the project, which was already underway. Eventually, the success of Lord of the Rings made him a household name - a difficult consequence for the ever private and introspective Viggo.Critics have continually recognized his work in over thirty movies, including such diverse projects as Jane Campion\'s The Portrait of a Lady (1996), Sean Penn\'s The Indian Runner (1991), Brian De Palma\'s Шлях Карлiто (1993), Ridley Scott\'s Солдат Джейн (1997), Tony Scott\'s Crimson Tide (1995), Andrew Davis\'s Iдеальне вбивство (1998), Ray Loriga\'s La pistola de mi hermano (1997), Tony Goldwyn\'s A Walk on the Moon (1999), and Peter Farrelly\'s Зелена книга (2018).Mortensen is also an accomplished poet, photographer and painter.'),(570,'Jada Pinkett Smith','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzOTE1MjQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzczNTkwNjE@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1971-09-18','Jada Koren Pinkett Smith was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Robsol Grant Pinkett, Jr., a contractor, and Adrienne Banfield-Jones, a nurse.

She attended Sylvia Young Theatre School, part-time, before moving to Kosovo with her family in 2008. Lipa grew up listening to her father, singer Dukagjin Lipa. Her given name means \"love\" in Albanian; its atypical nature was cause for distaste in her youth, but she grew to \"enjoy\" it as it eliminated the need for a stage name. At the age of 14, she began posting covers of her favorite songs by artists such as P!nk and Nelly Furtado on YouTube. At the age of 15, she moved back to London with aspirations of becoming a singer. Shortly after, she began working as a model.

In Australia and New Zealand, the song became an airplay success, reaching numbers 6 and 20 respectively. Lipa describes her musical style as \"dark pop\". On 30 November 2015, she was revealed as one of the acts on the BBC Sound of...2016 long list. Her first tour in the UK and Europe began in January 2016.

He lived in Stockholm until the age of 13, when he moved in with his grandparents in Nyland, Ångermanland, Sweden. Despite an early interest in music and the fine arts, Dolph decided to follow in his father\'s footsteps and pursue an Engineering degree. After having completed his military service, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.It was in the military when Dolph first came in contact with the martial arts. Five years later, Dolph had become a World-Class competitor in Japanese Karate and was deeply involved with a discipline that was to become an important part of his life. After graduating High School, Dolph spent considerable time studying in the United States and abroad on various academic scholarships. He attended Washington State University and Clemson University in South Carolina. In 1982, he received a scholarship to complete his Masters Degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia. In 1983, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, one of the world\'s top engineering schools. That same year, Dolph decided to move to New York City and take up acting. He started studying drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop in Manhattan, not knowing how quickly his life was about to change. Dolph\'s motion picture debut came in the \"James Bond\" feature, 007: Вид на вбивство (1985). However, it was his performance in Роккi IV (1985) later that year that definitely got him noticed. After a 9-month audition process among 5,000 hopefuls, he was cast opposite writer-director Sylvester Stallone, as his Russian opponent, \"Ivan Drago\". Following the success of Роккi IV (1985), Lundgren moved to Los Angeles and has since starred in more than thirty feature films.Lundgren portrayed the classic action-heroic lead in such films as Gary Goddard\'s Masters of the Universe (1987), Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991) co-starring Brandon Lee and Blackjack (1998), by Hong-Kong action legend, John Woo. Lundgren has also continued to turning in memorable performances as the main adversary to other action-stars, most notably in Унiверсальний солдат (1992) opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme, directed by Roland Emmerich, as well as Robert Longo\'s Johnny Mnemonic (1995) opposite Keanu Reeves. In February 2004, Dolph Lundgren directed his first feature film, the thriller The Defender (2004), in which he also starred. In 2005, he directed and starred in yet another feature, The Mechanik (2005) (a.k.a \"The Russian Specialist\"). In January 2006, he finished principal photography of L\'inchiesta (2006), an Italian/American/Spanish co-production, directed by Giulio Base, in which he played against, amongst others, Daniele Liotti, Max von Sydow and F. Murray Abraham. In the fall 2006, Lundgren starred in Diamond Dogs (2007), a Chinese/American co-production filmed on location in Mongolia. In the Spring 2007, he directed a modern day western shot in Texas, Missionary Man (2007).In 2009, he completed two new directorial efforts, the action-packed Command Performance (2009), which showcases Lundgren\'s longtime musical talents as a drummer; and the neo-noir thriller Icarus (2010). Lundgren also reunited with co-stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sylvester Stallone for Унiверсальний солдат: Вiдродження (2009) and the highly anticipated action blockbuster, Нестримнi (2010). Dolph has managed to not let his Hollywood career stand in the way of his athletic background. He has been awarded his Third Degree Black Belt by the World Karate Organization in Tokyo. His accomplishments include being the Captain of the Swedish National Karate Team, as well as a Champion of the Swedish, European and Australian Heavyweight Division titles. Lundgren still regularly performs Karate exhibitions at international tournaments worldwide. In addition to his Karate expertise, Dolph was selected by the U.S. Olympic Committee to serve as the Team Leader of the 1996 U.S. Olympic Pentathlon Team during the Atlanta Games.He is actively involved in promoting the image of this sport. Lundgren\'s production company, Thor Pictures, is developing several projects in which he will produce, star and/or direct. He is also a founding member of \"Group of Eight\", a New York theater group started in 1994. Lundgren has also been working on a fitness book and sports wear line for men, the creation and launch of a new Dolph Lundgren brand, a licensing, media and publishing program and the development of future entertainment and media projects.

She has Irish, English, and Swiss-German ancestry. She grew up with an older brother Donald Young III and a sister Cathleen Young in Cleveland, Ohio. She attended Cleveland Heights High School, and then transferred to and graduated from Interlochen Arts Academy. A trained dancer, she studied at the School of American Ballet in New York City, and did some modeling. Sean Young began a promising film career by acting in a Merchant-Ivory film Jane Austen in Manhattan (1980) for Academy Award winning director James Ivory, She followed that up in the comedy hit film Stripes (1981) for Academy Award nominated producer-director Ivan Reitman. Soon, important directors were casting her in their films, such as Garry Marshall in Young Doctors in Love (1982), Academy Award nominee David Lynch in Дюна (1984), and Academy Award nominee Ridley Scott in Той, хто бiжить по лезу (1982) in what is her most respected film. 1987 was a big year for her, since she appeared in two big movies. Academy Award winner Oliver Stone cast her in the hit film Волл-Стрiт (1987). However, her other hit film No Way Out (1987), which involved a famous steamy scene in the backseat of a limousine with Kevin Costner, gave her star status. She was at the height of her fame, which led to her being cast as Vicky Vale in Бетмен (1989). She had an accident while she was training for the film. As a result, she lost the role to Kim Basinger for what turned out to be the biggest hit of 1989. Young put on a brave face and gamely moved on to do comedies Fatal Instinct (1993) for director Carl Reiner, and Ейс Вентура: Детектив з розшуку домашнiх тварин (1994), the latter\'s box office success made Jim Carrey a star, who immediately landed the role of the Riddler in the Batman sequel.

His mother, Ann, was a teacher and landscape painter. His father, Ernie, was a journalist who had changed the family name from \"Smith\" to \"Roth\"; Ernie was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an immigrant family of Irish ancestry.Tim grew up in Dulwich, a middle-class area in the south of London. He demonstrated his talent for picking up accents at an early age when he attended school in Brixton, where he faced persecution from classmates for his comfortable background and quickly perfected a cockney accent to blend in. He attended Camberwell Art College and studied sculpture before he dropped out and pursued acting.The blonde actor\'s first big break was the British TV movie Made in Britain (1982). Roth made a huge splash in that film as a young skinhead named Trevor. He next worked with director Mike Leigh on Meantime (1983), which he has counted among his favorite projects. He debuted on the big screen when he filled in for Joe Strummer in the Stephen Frears neo-noir The Hit (1984). Roth gained more attention for his turn as Vincent Van Gogh in Vincent & Theo (1990) and his work opposite Gary Oldman in Розенкранц i Гiльденстерн мертвi (1990).He moved to Los Angeles in search of work and caught the eye of young director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino had envisioned Roth as a possible Mr. Blonde or Mr. Pink in his heist flick Скаженi пси (1992), but Roth campaigned for the role of Mr. Orange instead, and ultimately won the part. It proved to be a huge breakthrough for Roth, as audiences found it difficult to forget his performance as a member of a group of jewelry store robbers who is slowly bleeding to death. Tarantino cast Roth again in the landmark film Кримiнальне чтиво (1994). Roth and actress Amanda Plummer played a pair of robbers who hold up a restaurant. 1995 saw the third of Roth\'s collaborations with Tarantino, a surprisingly slapstick performance in the anthology film Чотири кiмнати (1995). That same year Roth picked up an Academy Award nomination for his campy turn as a villain in the period piece Rob Roy (1995).Continuing to take on disparate roles, Roth did his own singing (with an American accent to boot) in the lightweight Woody Allen musical Everyone Says I Love You (1996). He starred opposite Tupac Shakur in Shakur\'s last film, the twisted comedy Gridlock\'d (1997). The pair received positive critical notices for their comic chemistry. Standing in contrast to the criminals and baddies that crowd his CV, Roth\'s work as the innocent, seafaring pianist in the Giuseppe Tornatore film Легенда про пiанiста посеред океану (1998) became something of a fan favorite. Grittier fare followed when Roth made his directorial debut with The War Zone (1999), a frank, critically acclaimed drama about a family torn apart by incest. He made his next high-profile appearance as an actor as General Thade, an evil simian in the Tim Burton remake of Планета Мавп (2001). Roth was, of course, all but unrecognizable in his primate make-up.Roth has continued to enjoy a mix of art house and mainstream work, including everything from the lead role in Francis Ford Coppola\'s esoteric Youth Without Youth (2007) to becoming \"The Abomination\" in the special effects-heavy blockbuster Неймовiрний Халк (2008). Roth took his first major American television role when he signed on to the Fox-TV series Теорiя Брехнi (2009)'),(576,'Chloe Bennet','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZmY2YwOGUtMWUwNy00ZmQ2LTg3OWEtZjliMzhmZDExZGNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzM4MDIwOTQ@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1992-04-18','Chloe Bennet is an American actress and singer.

She is the daughter of acting coach Burton Eugene \"Burt\" Lane and nightclub singer/centerfold Colleen Farrington. Her parents\' families were both from the state of Georgia. Diane was acting from a very young age and made her stage debut at the age of six. Her work in such acclaimed theater productions as \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Medea\" led to her being called to Hollywood. She was 13 when she was cast by director George Roy Hill in his wonderful 1979 film A Little Romance (1979), opposite Sir Laurence Olivier. The film only did so-so commercially, but Olivier praised his young co-star, calling her the new Grace Kelly. After her well-received debut, Diane found herself on magazine covers all over the world, including \"Time\", which declared her the \"new young acting sensation\". However, things quietened down a bit when she found herself in such critical and financial flops as Touched by Love (1980), Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981), Movie Madness (1982), Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and, most unmemorably, Six Pack (1982), all of which failed to set her career on fire.She also made several TV movies during this period, but it was in 1983 that she finally began to fulfill the promise of stardom that had earlier been predicted for her. Acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola took note of Diane\'s appeal and cast her in two \"youth\"-oriented films based on S.E. Hinton novels. Indeed, Rumble Fish (1983) and The Outsiders (1983) have become cult classics and resulted in her getting a loyal fan base. The industry was now taking notice of Diane Lane, and she soon secured lead roles in three big-budget studio epics. She turned down the first, Сплеск (1984) (which was a surprise hit for Daryl Hannah). Unfortunately, the other two were critical and box-office bombs: Walter Hill\'s glossy rock \'n\' roll fable Streets of Fire (1984) was not the huge summer success that many had thought it would be, and the massively troubled Coppola epic The Cotton Club (1984) co-starring Richard Gere was also a high-profile flop. The back-to-back failure of both of these films could have ended her career there and then -- but thankfully it didn\'t. Possibly \"burned out\" by the lambasting these films received and unhappy with the direction her career was taking, she \"retired\" from the film business at age 19, saying that she had forgotten what she had started acting for. She stayed away from the screen for the next three years. Ironically, the two films that were the main causes of her \"retirement\" have since grown in popularity, and \"Streets of Fire\" especially seems to have found the kind of audience it couldn\'t get when it was first released.The process of rebuilding her career was a slow and gradual one. First came the obscure and very sexy straight-to-video thriller Lady Beware (1987), followed by the critically acclaimed but little seen The Big Town (1987) with Matt Dillon and Tommy Lee Jones. In the former, Diane plays a very mysterious and sexy stripper and her memorable strip sequence is a highlight of the film. Despite her sexy new on-screen image, it wasn\'t until 1989\'s smash hit TV mini-series Lonesome Dove (1989) that Diane made another big impression on a sizable audience. Her performance in the hugely popular and critically acclaimed western epic as a vulnerable \"whore with a heart\" won her an Emmy nomination and much praise. Film producers were interested in her again. Another well-received TV production, Descending Angel (1990), was followed by smaller roles in major films like Richard Attenborough\'s Чаплiн (1992) and Mike Binder\'s Indian Summer (1993), and larger parts in small independent films like My New Gun (1992), Vital Signs (1990) and Knight Moves (1992). Indeed, the latter two films co-starred her then-husband, Christopher Lambert, with whom she had a daughter named Eleanor.Diane was now re-established in Hollywood and started to appear in higher-profile co-starring roles in some big-budget, major movies like Walter Hill\'s Wild Bill (1995), the Sylvester Stallone actioner Суддя Дредд (1995), the Robin Williams\'s comedy Jack (1996) and Murder at 1600 (1997) co-starring Wesley Snipes. However, all of these still did not quite make Diane a \"big-name star\" and, by 1997, she found herself, possibly by choice, back in smaller, personal projects.Her next role as a frustrated 1960s housewife in the independent hit A Walk on the Moon (1999) deservedly won her rave notices and, at last, gave her career the big lift it needed. The cute but tear-jerking comedy Мiй пес Скiп (2000) also proved to be a small-scale success. However, it was the £330-million worldwide grossing blockbuster hit Iдеальний шторм (2000) that finally made Diane Lane the household name that she always should have been.After the worldwide success of \"The Perfect Storm\", she was more in demand than ever. She played Leelee Sobieski\'s sinister junkie guardian in the slick thriller Скляний будинок (2001), and co-starred with Keanu Reeves in the #1 smash hit Hard Ball (2001). However, her greatest career moment was still to come with her lead role in the enormous critical and commercial hit Невiрна (2002), in which she superbly portrayed Richard Gere\'s adulterous wife. Her performance won the respect of critics and audiences alike, as well as many awards and nominations including Best Actress Oscar and Golden Globe nominations.Her follow-up films including Пiд сонцем Тоскани (2003), Must Love Dogs (2005), Hollywoodland (2006), Чемпiон (2010), and the blockbuster, Людина зi сталi (2013), were all received and her performances were highly praised. She won further Best Actress Golden Globe nominations for her roles in Пiд сонцем Тоскани (2003) and Cinema Verite (2011).She is very well regarded within the industry, adored by film fans, and has a credibility and quality that is all too rare today. Her immense talent at playing human and real characters, her \"drop dead gorgeous\" beauty and down-to-earth grittiness guarantees that she will stay on top, and she guarantee has already shown the kind of resilience that will keep her working for a long, long time.'),(578,'Poppy Montgomery','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NjIyODU5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzAxMjAz._V1_UY317_CR27,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1972-06-15','Poppy Montgomery has found success and prominence by playing the dramatic role of FBI agent Samantha Spade in the popular TV series Without a Trace (2002).

She was raised in Sydney. Since the age of 12, Poppy had a near obsession with cultural icon Marilyn Monroe.Her parents had named each of their five daughters after a flower and, after a time, the name \"Poppy Petal\" attracted so much derision from fellow students that she left school at the age of 14. At 16, she left home to travel abroad and, at 18, she traveled to America.In Los Angeles, penniless and with a copy of \"How to Make it in Hollywood\", Poppy adopted her mother\'s maiden name as a stage name and made daily contact with Julia Roberts\'s agent who told her he did not handle unknowns but arranged for her to be signed with another agent.After various minor roles, Montgomery got several breaks in 1996. She had guest appearances on TV series NYPD Blue (1993) and Party of Five (1994), she got a regular part in the TV series Relativity (1996), and she won a starring role in the TV movie The Cold Equations (1996). Her career has been on an upward climb ever since.In 2001, Montgomery won the dream role of her lifetime. CBS was looking to create a TV mini-series based on author Joyce Carol Oates\' novelization of the life of Marilyn Monroe (the series was titled Blonde (2001)). Poppy\'s greatest wish was fulfilled when she got cast as her childhood idol. When she told her family that she\'d won the role, Poppy\'s mother blithely commented \"Well, you\'ve been rehearsing for it your whole life\". Montgomery gained weight for the part to more closely resemble Monroe. Her portrayal won critical acclaim.In 2002, Montgomery joined the original cast of the soon-to-be-successful TV series Without a Trace (2002). She has a lead role portraying FBI agent Samantha Spade.

Daniel was educated at Sevenoaks School in Kent, which he despised, and the more progressive Bedales in Petersfield, which he adored. He studied acting at the Bristol Old Vic School. Daniel made his film debut in Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), but then acted on stage with the Bristol Old Vic and Royal Shakespeare Companies and did not appear on screen again until 1982, when he landed his first adult role, a bit part in Гандi (1982). He also appeared on British television that year in Frost in May (1982) and BBC2 Playhouse: How Many Miles to Babylon? (1982).

Hopper was born on May 17, 1936 in Dodge City, Kansas, to Marjorie Mae (Davis) and James Millard Hopper. The young Hopper expressed interest in acting from a young age and first appeared in a slew of 1950s television series, including Medic (1954), Cheyenne (1955) and Sugarfoot (1957). His first film role was in Johnny Guitar (1954), which was quickly followed by roles in Бунт без причини (1955), Гiгант (1956) and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). Hopper actually became good friends with James Dean and was shattered when Dean was killed in a car crash on September 30, 1955.Hopper portrayed a young Napoléon Bonaparte (!) in the star-spangled The Story of Mankind (1957) and regularly appeared on screen throughout the 1960s, often in rather undemanding parts, usually as a villain in westerns such as Справжня мужнiсть (1969) and Hang \'Em High (1968). However, in early 1969, Hopper, fellow actor Peter Fonda and writer Terry Southern, wrote a counterculture road movie script and managed to scrape together $400,000 in financial backing. Hopper directed the low-budget film, titled Безтурботний байкер (1969), starring Fonda, Hopper and a young Jack Nicholson. The film was a phenomenal box-office success, appealing to the anti-establishment youth culture of the times. It changed the Hollywood landscape almost overnight and major studios all jumped onto the anti-establishment bandwagon, pumping out low-budget films about rebellious hippies, bikers, draft dodgers and pot smokers. However, Hopper\'s next directorial effort, The Last Movie (1971), was a critical and financial failure, and he has admitted that during the 1970s he was seriously abusing various substances, both legal and illegal, which led to a downturn in the quality of his work. He appeared in a sparse collection of European-produced films over the next eight years, before cropping up in a memorable performance as a pot-smoking photographer alongside Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen in Francis Ford Coppola\'s Vietnam War epic Апокалiпсис наших днiв (1979). He also received acclaim for his work in both acting and direction for Out of the Blue (1980).With these two notable efforts, the beginning of the 1980s saw a renaissance of interest by Hollywood in the talents of Dennis Hopper and exorcising the demons of drugs and alcohol via a rehabilitation program meant a return to invigorating and provoking performances. He was superb in Rumble Fish (1983), co-starred in the tepid spy thriller The Osterman Weekend (1983), played a groovy school teacher in My Science Project (1985), was a despicable and deranged drug dealer in River\'s Edge (1986) and, most memorably, electrified audiences as foul-mouthed Frank Booth in the eerie and erotic David Lynch film Синiй оксамит (1986). Interestingly, the offbeat Hopper was selected in the early 1980s to provide the voice of \"The StoryTeller\" in the animated series of \"Rabbit Ears\" children\'s films based upon the works of Hans Christian Andersen!Hopper returned to film direction in the late 1980s and was at the helm of the controversial gang film Colors (1988), which was well received by both critics and audiences. He was back in front of the cameras for roles in Супербрати Марiо (1993), got on the wrong side of gangster Christopher Walken in Справжнe кохання (1993), led police officer Keanu Reeves and bus passenger Sandra Bullock on a deadly ride in Швидкiсть (1994) and challenged gill-man Kevin Costner for world supremacy in Водний свiт (1995). The enigmatic Hopper has continued to remain busy through the 1990s and into the new century with performances in The Night We Called It a Day (2003), The Keeper (2004) and Land of the Dead (2005).As well as his acting/directing talents, Hopper was a skilled photographer and painter, having had his works displayed in galleries in both the United States and overseas. He was additionally a dedicated and knowledgeable collector of modern art and has one of the most extensive collections in the United States.

(2011), and Winston Churchill in Темнi часи (2017), among many others. For much of his career, he was best-known for playing over-the-top antagonists, such as terrorist Egor Korshunov in the 1997 blockbuster Лiтак президента (1997), though he has reached a new audience with heroic roles in the Harry Potter and Dark Knight franchises. He is also a filmmaker, musician, and author.Gary Leonard Oldman was born on March 21, 1958 in New Cross, London, England, to Kathleen (Cheriton), a homemaker, and Leonard Bertram Oldman, a welder. He won a scholarship to Britain\'s Rose Bruford Drama College, in Sidcup, Kent, where he received a B.A. in theatre arts in 1979. He subsequently studied with the Greenwich Young People\'s Theatre and went on to appear in a number of plays throughout the early \'80s, including \"The Pope\'s Wedding,\" for which he received Time Out\'s Fringe Award for Best Newcomer of 1985-1986 and the British Theatre Association\'s Drama Magazine Award as Best Actor for 1985. Before fame, he was employed as a worker in assembly lines, and as a porter in an operating theater. He also got jobs selling shoes and beheading pigs while supporting his early acting career.His film debut was Remembrance (1982), though his most-memorable early role came when he played Sex Pistol Sid Vicious in the biopic Sid and Nancy (1986) picking up the Evening Standard Film Award as Best Newcomer. He then received a Best Actor nomination from BAFTA for his portrayal of \'60s playwright Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears (1987).In the 1990s, Oldman brought to life a series of iconic real-world and fictional villains including Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK (1991), the title character in Дракула (1992), Drexl Spivey in Справжнe кохання (1993), Stansfield in Леон (1994), Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg in П\'ятий елемент (1997) and Ivan Korshunov in Лiтак президента (1997).

Oldman also took on the iconic role of Detective James Gordon in writer-director Christopher Nolan\'s Бетмен: Початок (2005), a role he played again in Темний лицар (2008) and Темний лицар повертаеться (2012).

Rodríguez, a salesman. His family is of Mexican descent.Of all the people to be amazed by the images of John Carpenter\'s 1981 sci-fi parable, Втеча з Нью-Йорка (1981), none were as captivated as the 12-year-old Rodriguez, who sat with his friends in a crowded cinema. Many people watch films and arrogantly proclaim \"I can do that.\" This young man said something different: \"I WILL do that. I\'m gonna make movies.\" That day was the catalyst of his dream career. Born and raised in Texas, Robert was the middle child of a family that would include 10 children. While many a child would easily succumb to a Jan Brady sense of being lost in the shuffle, Robert always stood out as a very creative and very active young man. An artist by nature, he was very rarely seen sans pencil-in-hand doodling some abstract (yet astounding) dramatic feature on a piece of paper. His mother, not a fan of the \"dreary\" cinema of the 1970s, instills a sense of cinema in her children by taking them on weekly trips to San Antonio\'s famed Olmos Theatre movie house and treats them to a healthy dose of Hollywood\'s \"Golden Age\" wonders, from Sergio Leone to the silent classic of Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton.In a short amount of time, young Robert finds the family\'s old Super-8 film camera and makes his first films. The genres are unlimited: action, sci-fi, horror, drama, stop-motion animation. He uses props from around the house, settings from around town, and makes use of the largest cast and crew at his disposal: his family. At the end of the decade, his father, a salesman, brings home the latest home-made technological wonder: a VCR, and with it (as a gift from the manufacturer) a video camera. With this new equipment at his disposal, he makes movies his entire life. He screens the movies for friends, all of whom desperately want to star in the next one. He gains a reputation in the neighborhood as \"the kid who makes movies\". Rather than handing in term papers, he is allowed to hand in \"term movies\" because, as he himself explains, \"[the teachers] knew I\'d put more effort into a movie than I ever would into an essay.\" He starts his own comic strip, \"Los Hooligans\". His movies win every local film competition and festival. When low academic grades threaten to keep him out of UT Austin\'s renowned film department, he proves his worth the only way he knows how: he makes a movie. Three, in fact: trilogy of short movies called \"Austin Stories\" starring his siblings. It beats the entries of the school\'s top students and allows Robert to enter the program. After being accepted into the film department, Robert takes $400 of his own money to make his \"biggest\" film yet: a 16mm short comedy/fantasy called Bedhead (1991).Pouring every idea and camera trick he knew into the short, it went on to win multiple awards. After meeting and marrying fellow Austin resident Elizabeth Avellan, Robert comes up with a crazy idea: he will sell his body to science in order to finance his first feature-length picture (a Mexican action adventure about a guitarist with no name looking for work but getting caught up in a shoot-\'em-up adventure) that he will sell to the Spanish video market and use as an entry point to a lucrative Hollywood career. With his \"guinea pig\" money he raises a mere $7,000 and creates Музикант (1992). But rather than lingering in obscurity, the film finds its way to the Sundance film festival where it becomes an instant favorite, wins Robert a distribution deal with Columbia Pictures and turns him into an icon among would-be film-makers the world over. Not one to rest on his laurels, he immediately helms the straight-to-cable movie Roadracers (1994) and contributes a segment to the anthology comedy Чотири кiмнати (1995) (his will be the most lauded segment).His first \"genuine\" studio effort would soon have people referring to him as \"John Woo from south-of-the-border\". It is the \"Mariachi\" remake/sequel Десперадо (1995). More lavish and action-packed than its own predecessor, the movie--while not a blockbuster hit--does decent business and launches the American film careers of Antonio Banderas as the guitarist-turned-gunslinger and Salma Hayek as his love interest (the two would star in several of his movies from then on). It also furthers the director\'s reputation of working on low budgets to create big results. In the year when movies like Batman Forever (1995) and 007: Золоте око (1995) were pushing budgets past the $100 million mark, Rodriguez brought in \"Desperado\" for just under $7 million. The film also featured a cameo by fellow indie film wunderkind, Quentin Tarantino. It would be the beginning of a long friendship between the two sprinkled with numerous collaborations. Most notable the Tarantino-penned vampire schlock-fest Вiд заходу до свiтанку (1996). The kitschy flick (about a pair of criminal brothers on the run from the Texas Rangers, only to find themselves in a vamp-infested Mexican bar) became an instant cult favorite and launched the lucrative film career of Швидка допомога (1994) star George Clooney.After a two-year break from directing (primarily to spend with his family, but also developing story ideas and declining Hollywood offers) he returned to \"Dusk till Dawn\" territory with the teen sci-fi/horror movie Факультет (1998), written by Крик (1996) writer, Kevin Williamson. Although it\'s developed a small following of its own, it would prove to be Robert\'s least-successful film. Critics and fans alike took issue with the pedestrian script, the off-kilter casting and the flick\'s blatant over-commercialization (due to a marketing deal with clothing designer Tommy Hilfiger). After another three-year break, Rodriguez returned to make his most successful (and most unexpected) movie yet, based on his own segment from Чотири кiмнати (1995). After a string of bloody, adult-oriented action fare, no one anticipated him to write and direct the colorful and creative Дiти шпигунiв (2001), a movie about a pair of prepubescent Latino sibs who discover that their lame parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) are actually two of the world\'s greatest secret agents. The film was hit among both audiences and critics alike.After quitting the Writers\' Guild of America and being introduced to digital filmmaking by George Lucas, Robert immediately applied the creative, flexible (and cost-effective) technology to every one of his movies from then on, starting with an immediate sequel to his family friendly hit: Дiти шпигунiв 2: Острiв загублених мрiй (2002) which was THEN immediately followed by the trilogy-capper Дiти шпигунiв 3D: Кiнець гри (2003). The latter would prove to be the most financially-lucrative of the series and employ the long-banished movie gimmick of 3-D with eye-popping results. Later the same year Rodriguez career came full circle when he completed the final entry of the story that made brought him to prominence: \"El Mariachi\". The last chapter, Якось у Мексицi (2003), would be his most direct homage to the Sergio Leone westerns he grew up on. With a cast boasting Antonio Banderas (returning as the gunslinging guitarist), Johnny Depp (as a corrupt CIA agent attempting to manipulate him), Salma Hayek, Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe and Eva Mendes, the film delivered even more of the Mexican shoot-\'em-up spectacle than both of the previous films combined.Now given his choice of movies to do next, Robert sought out famed comic book writer/artist Frank Miller, a man who had been very vocal of never letting his works be adapted for the screen. Even so, he was wholeheartedly convinced and elated when Rodriguez presented him with a plan to turn Miller\'s signature work into the film Мiсто грiхiв (2005). A collection of noir-ish tales set in a fictional, crime-ridden slum, the movie boasted the largest cast Rodriguez had worked with to that date. Saying he didn\'t want to mere \"adapt\" Miller\'s comics but \"translate\" them, Rodriguez\' insistence that Miller co-direct the movie lead to Robert\'s resignation from the Director\'s Guild of America (and his subsequent dismissal from the film Джон Картер: Мiж двох свiтiв (2012) as a result). Many critics cited that Sin City was created as a pure film noir piece to adapt Miller\'s comics onto the screen. Co-directing with Frank Miller and bringing in Quentin Tarantino to guest-direct a scene allowed Rodriguez to again shock Hollywood with his talent.In late 2007, Rodriguez again teamed up with his friend Tarantino to create the double feature Грайндхаус (2007). Rodriguez\'s offering, Planet Terror (2007), was a film made to be \"hardcore, extreme, sex-fueled, action-packed.\" Rodriguez flirts with his passion to make a showy film exploiting all of his experience to make an extremely entertaining thrill ride. The film is encompassed around Cherry (Rose McGowan), a reluctant go-go dancer who is found wanting when she meets her ex-lover El Wray (played by Freddy Rodríguez) who turns up at a local BBQ grill. They then, after a turn of events, find themselves fending off brain-eating zombies whilst trying to flee to Mexico (here we go off to Mexico again). Apart from directing, Rodriguez also involves himself in camera work, editing and composing music for his movies\' sound tracks (he composed Planet Terror\'s main theme). He also shoots a lot of his own action scenes to get a direct idea from his eye as the director into the film. In Музикант (1992), Rodriguez spent hours in front of a pay-to-use, computer editing his film. This allowed him to capture the ideal footage exactly as he wanted it. Away from the filming aspect of Hollywood, Rodriguez is an expert chef who cooks gourmet meals for the cast and crew. Rodriguez is also known for his ability to turn a low-budgeted film with a small crew into an example of film mastery. El mariachi was \"the movie made on seven grand\" and still managed to rank as one of Rodriguez\' best films (receiving a rating of 92% on the Rotten Tomatoes film review site).Because Rodriguez is involved so deeply in his films, he is able to capture what he wants first time, which saves both time and money. Rodriguez\'s films share some similar threads and ideas, whilst also having differences. In Музикант (1992), he uses a hand-held camera. He made this decision for several reasons. First, he couldn\'t afford a tripod and secondly, he wanted to make the audience more aware of the action. In the action sequences he is given more mobility with a hand-held camera and also allows for distortion of the unprofessional action sequences (because the cost of all special effects in the film totaled $600). However, in Мiсто грiхiв (2005) and Planet Terror (2007), the budget was much greater, and Rodriguez could afford to spend more on special affects (especially since both films were filmed predominately with green screen) and, thus, there was no need to cover for error.Playing by his own rules or not at all, Robert Rodriguez has redefined what a filmmaker can or cannot do. Shunning Hollywood\'s ridiculously high budgets, multi-picture deals and the two most powerful unions for the sake of maintaining creative freedom are decisions that would (and have) cost many directors their careers. Rodriguez has turned these into his strengths, creating some of the most imaginative works the big-screen has ever seen.'),(603,'Tilda Swinton','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NzMzMTkwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU4MDg1Mw@@._V1_UY317_CR19,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1960-11-05','The iconoclastic gifts of the visually striking and fiercely talented actress Tilda Swinton have been appreciated by a more international audience of late.She was born Katherine Mathilda Swinton on November 5, 1960, in London, England. Her mother, Judith Balfour, Lady Swinton (née Killen), was Australian, and her father, Major-General Sir John Swinton, an army officer, was English-born. Her ancestry is Scottish, Northern Irish, and English, including a long tapestry of prominent Scottish ancestors. Born into a patrician military family, she was educated at an English and a Scottish boarding school. Tilda subsequently studied Social and Political Science at Cambridge University and graduated in 1983 with a degree in English Literature. During her time as a student, she performed countless stage productions and proceeded to work for a season in the Royal Shakespeare Company. A decided rebel when it came to the arts, she left the company after a year as her approach shifted dramatically: With a taste for the unique and bizarre, she found some genuinely interesting gender-bending roles come her way, such as the composer Mozart in Pushkin\'s \"Mozart and Salieri\", and as a working class woman impersonating her dead husband during World War II, in Karges\' Screenplay: Man to Man: Another Night of Rubbish on the Telly (1992). In 1985 the pale-skinned, carrot-topped actress began a professional association with gay experimental director Derek Jarman. She continued to live and work with Jarman for the next nine years, developing seven critically acclaimed films. Their alliance would produce stark turns, such as turner-prize nominated Caravaggio (1986), The Last of England (1987), The Garden (1990), Edward II (1991), and Wittgenstein (1993). Jarman succumbed to complications from AIDS in 1994. His untimely demise left a devastating void in Tilda\'s life for quite some time. Her most notable performance of that period however comes from a non-Jarman film: For the title role in Orlando (1992), her nobleman character lives for 400 years while changing sex from man to woman. The film, which Swinton spent years helping writer/director Sally Potter develop and finance, continues to this day to have a worldwide devoted fan following. Over the years she has preferred art to celebrity, opening herself to experimental projects with new and untried directors and mediums, delving into the worlds of installation art and cutting-edge fashion. Consistently off-centered roles in Female Perversions (1996), Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998), Teknolust (2002), Young Adam (2003), Зламанi квiти (2005) and Béla Tarr\'s A londoni férfi (2007) have only added to her mystique. Hollywood too has picked up on this notoriety and, since the birth of her twins in 1997, she has successfully moved between the deep-left-field art-house and quality Hollywood blockbusters. The thriller The Deep End (2001), earned her a number of critic\'s awards and her first Golden Globe nomination. Such mainstream U.S. pictures as Пляж (2000) with Leonardo DiCaprio, fantasy epic Константин (2005) with Keanu Reeves, her Oscar-decorated performance in Майкл Клейтон (2007) alongside George Clooney and of course her iconic White Witch in Хронiки Нарнii: Лев, чаклунка i чарiвна шафа (2005) have cemented her place as one of cinema\'s most outstanding women.She then starred in the crime drama Julia (2008); in David Fincher\'s Загадкова справа Бенджамiна Баттона (2008); learned Italian and Russian for Luca Guadagnino\'s Io sono l\'amore (2009); starred in the psychological thriller We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011); in Wes Anderson\'s Королiвство повного мiсяця (2012); in Joon Ho Bong\'s Снiгобур (2013) and in Terry Gilliam\'s Теорема Зеро (2013). Swinton later starred in the dark romantic fantasy drama, Виживуть тiльки коханцi (2013) directed by Jim Jarmusch and had a small role in Wes Anderson\'s Готель Гранд Будапешт (2014).In 2015, Swinton starred in Judd Apatow\'s comedy Дiвчина без комплексiв (2015), and played a Rock star in Luca Guadagnino\'s Великий сплеск (2015), starring opposite Matthias Schoenaerts and Ralph Fiennes.In 2016, she starred in Joel & Ethan Coen\'s Аве, Цезар!

His father\'s ancestry is Italian, and his mother is of half French-Canadian and half Italian descent. Mark moved with his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he lived out most of his teenage years. Following high school, Mark moved with his family to San Diego and soon migrated north, eventually settling in Los Angeles. He took classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory and subsequently co-founded the Orpheus Theatre Company, an Equity-Waiver establishment, where he worked in nearly every capacity. From acting, writing, directing and producing to running the lights and building sets while building his resume. Bartending for nearly nine years to make ends meet and ready to give it all up, a chance meeting and resulting collaboration with playwright/screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan changed everything.Ruffalo won NY success in Lonergan\'s play \"This Is Our Youth\", which led to the male lead in Lonergan\'s film Можеш розраховувати на мене (2000), playing the ne\'er-do-well brother of Laura Linney. The performance drew rave reviews and invited comparisons to an early Marlon Brando. Notable roles in The Last Castle (2001), XX/XY (2002), and Тi, що говорять iз вiтром (2002) followed, although in 2002 Ruffalo was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, a type of brain tumor. Though the tumor was benign, the resulting surgery led to a period of partial facial paralysis, from which he fully recovered. In 2003, Ruffalo scored leading roles alongside two popular female stars, playing a police detective opposite Meg Ryan in In the Cut (2003) and the love interest of Gwyneth Paltrow in the comedy View from the Top (2003). Though both films were high-profile box office disappointments, Ruffalo went on to four notable (if highly disparate) films in 2004 - We Don\'t Live Here Anymore (2004), Вiчне сяйво чистого розуму (2004), 13 Going on 30 (2004), and Спiвучасник (2004) - which solidified his ability to be both a popular leading man and an acclaimed ensemble player in either comedy or drama.After 2004, Ruffalo was consistently at work, with leads in popular Hollywood films and independent productions that continued to solidify him as one of film\'s most consistently strong actors: Мiж небом i землею (2005), Уся королiвська рать (2006), Зодiак (2007), Reservation Road (2007), and The Brothers Bloom (2008). In 2010 Ruffalo achieved something of a breakthrough, by directing the indie film Sympathy for Delicious (2010), which won him the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and co-starring as the sperm-donor father to lesbian couple Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in Дiтки в порядку (2010). His role in the idiosyncratic domestic comedy/drama earned him Academy Award, Independent Spirit Award, Screen Actors Guild, and BAFTA nominations for Best Supporting Actor.High-profile roles in Martin Scorsese\'s Острiв проклятих (2010) and \'Kenneth Longeran\'\'s long-delayed Margaret (2011) followed before Ruffalo\'s appearance as Dr. Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk, in Joss Whedon\'s blockbuster Месники (2012). Garnering highly positive reviews for a role in which actors Eric Bana and Edward Norton could not find success in previous films made Ruffalo a box office star in addition to a critically-acclaimed actor. He is expected to reprise the role in the upcoming 2015 sequel, and reunited with former co-star Gywneth Paltrow in the sex-addiction comedy-drama Thanks for Sharing (2012); Ruffalo also will take the lead in Ryan Murphy\'s adaptation of Larry Kramer\'s AIDS-drama play The Normal Heart (2014).Ruffalo has been married to actress Sunrise Coigney since 2000; the couple have three children, a son and two daughters.'),(606,'Busy Philipps','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0NTkwMzYyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY3MjIwNQ@@._V1_UY317_CR9,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1979-06-25','Busy was born Elizabeth Jean Philipps in Illinois, US.

The family moved to New York when he was two years old, living first in the Bronx and later in Manhattan. When Sam was five years old, his parents separated, at which point he and his father moved to San Francisco, where he subsequently grew up, while summers and other times were spent with his mother in New York.He made his acting debut when he was ten years old, alongside his mother, and later attended J Eugene McAteer High School in a program called SOTA. While still in high school, he got his first big break when he appeared in the independent film Clownhouse (1989). The plot revolved around three escaped mental patients who dressed up as clowns and terrorized three brothers home alone--Sam played the eldest of the brothers. His next big break was supposed to have come when he was slated to star in a short-lived NBC TV-series called Dream Street (1989), but he was soon fired.After graduating from high school, Sam returned to New York for good and for two years he had private training at the William Esper Acting Studio. During this period he appeared in a variety of roles, such as the ABC Afterschool Specials (1972): Over the Limit (1990) (TV) and HBO\'s Lifestories: Families in Crisis (1992): Dead Drunk: The Kevin Tunell Story (Season 1 Episode 7: 15 March 1993); the head thug in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990); and a guest-star turn in an Emmy Award-winning episode of Law & Order (1990), while working a string of regular day jobs and performing in plays.In 1994, a Miller Ice beer commercial finally enabled him to quit his other jobs to concentrate on his acting career, which culminated in him having five movies out by 1996: Basquiat (1996); The Search for One-eye Jimmy (1994); Glory Daze (1995); Mercy (1995); and Box of Moonlight (1996). It was the latter film that would prove to be his real break-out in the industry. In Tom DiCillo\'s film, he found himself playing an eccentric named the Kid, a man-child living in a half-built mobile home in the middle of nowhere with a penchant for dressing like Davy Crockett, who manages to bring some much-needed chaos into the life of an electrical engineer played by John Turturro. The movie was not a box-office success, but it managed to generate a great deal of critical acclaim for itself and Sam.In 1997, he found himself the star of another critically lauded film, Lawn Dogs (1997). Once again, he portrayed a societal outcast as Trent, a working-class man living in a trailer, earning a living mowing lawns inside a wealthy, gated Kentucky community. Trent soon finds himself befriended by 10-year-old Devon (Mischa Barton), and the movie deals with the difficulties in their friendship and the outside world. He also gave strong performances in the quirky independent comedy Safe Men (1998), in which he plays one half of a pretty awful singing duo (the other half being played by Steve Zahn) that gets mistaken for two safecrackers by Jewish gangsters; and the offbeat hitman trainee in Jerry and Tom (1998) against Joe Mantegna.After a few smaller appearances in films such as Woody Allen\'s Знаменитiсть (1998) and the modern version of A Midsummer Night\'s Dream (1999), in which he played Francis Flute, he had larger roles in two of the bigger hit movies to emerge: Зелена миля (1999) and Galaxy Quest (1999), wowing audiences and critics alike with his chameleon-like performances as a crazed killer in the former and a goofy actor in the latter.More recently, he appeared in another string of mainstream films, most notably as Eric Knox in Янголи Чарлi (2000) and as Zaphod Beeblebrox in Автостопом по галактицi (2005), while continuing to perform in smaller independent movies. After more than ten years in the business, Sam has earned his success.

She is the youngest of five children. Her parents are Barbara Anne (Barry) and Clifford Elwin \"Cliff\" Thompson. Since all her siblings were much older than she, Lea says it seemed like she had more than two parents. The family lived in the Starlight Motel, all the kids sharing a room. Things began to look up for the family when Lea\'s father got a job in Minneapolis, where the family moved.Lea\'s parents divorced when she was six, and her mother decided to maintain the family. This wasn\'t the easiest job, considering her mother was alcohol-addicted at the time. When she found the strength to quit drinking, she took a job playing the piano and singing in a bar to support Lea and her siblings. When Lea was seven, her mother remarried. Ever since Lea was little, she loved to dance -- ballet to be exact. She would practice three to four hours every day. Her first role was as a mouse in \"The Nutcracker\". After Lea turned fourteen, she had performed in more than 45 ballets on stages, such as The Minnesota Dance Theatre, The Pennsylvania Ballet Company, and The Ballet Repertory. She won scholarships to The American Ballet Theatre and The San Francisco Ballet. At age nineteen, she auditioned for Mikhail Baryshnikov, who later told her that she was \"a beautiful dancer... but too stocky\". Lea knew her dreams had been crushed. At that point, she decided to turn to acting. She began working as a waitress, also making 22 Burger King commercials and a few Twix commercials. She was perfect for these parts simply because she was the average girl-down-the-street, from the Midwest. Everyone who knows her can\'t believe she was and still is so completely different...trying to be independent and fight against the system. In 1982, Lea made some type of a computer game or interactive movie known as \"Murder, Anyone\".Her first role was in the movie, Щелепи 3 (1983), as a water ski bunny, although she couldn\'t swim or ski, which she still can\'t! There, she met Dennis Quaid, who became her fiancée and acting coach. Her next role was in All the Right Moves (1983), where she acted opposite Tom Cruise. Director Michael Chapman was so disappointed with her performance, that he almost fired her. Between 1983 and 1984, Lea appeared in other \"teen\" movies, such as Red Dawn (1984), The Wild Life (1984), and Going Undercover (aka Yellow Pages (1985)), and believes it was lucky that, in these movies, they were able to use anyone who could walk and talk! Lea\'s biggest known accomplishment, and her big break, came from the first Назад у майбутнe (1985). It was the biggest hit of 1985, and Lea was suddenly the most wanted actress. She could have her pick of any role she wanted to take on. She chose Howard the Duck (1986). Although it was a George Lucas production, the critics turned the movie, and Lea, down. Afterwards, director Howard Deutch offered Lea a part in his movie, Щось дивне (1987), but she refused. After he urged her to do it, she reconsidered. She won the Young Artist Award for best young actress. During filming, Howard and Lea fell in love, and she called it off with Dennis. She then went on to film The Wizard of Loneliness (1988), which was her first movie as a woman, rather than a youngster. Lea went on to film Назад у майбутнe 2 (1989) and an episode of Tales from the Crypt (1989). She then married Howard Deutch. She continued filming Назад у майбутнe 3 (1990), Montana (1990), and Article 99 (1992). Lea then took a break to stay home with her first born, Madelyn Deutch.She jumped back into acting in Деннiс-мучитель (1993), where she says she just played herself. Then it was on to The Beverly Hillbillies (1993), Stolen Babies (1993), Маленькi негiдники (1994), and The Substitute Wife (1994). In 1994, she had her second child, Zoey Deutch. Lea then went into filming The Unspoken Truth (1995). It was then that she was first given the script of a new NBC sitcom, Caroline in the City (1995). It was probably the best decision Lea ever made. She won a People\'s Choice Award for best actress in a new sitcom. Unfortunately, with all of NBC\'s problems, Caroline in the City (1995) kept being moved to a worse and worse time slot, giving it horrible ratings. The show ended after only four seasons. Bad ideas from the creators (Julia, etc.) didn\'t help, either.Lea quickly went onto The Right to Remain Silent (1996), The Unknown Cyclist (1998), and A Will of Their Own (1998). She also guest-starred in the Друзi (1994) episode, Друзi: The One with the Baby on the Bus (1995), as \"Caroline Duffy\", and on The Larry Sanders Show (1992). Lea also did some stage work, including starring as \"Sally Bowles\" in \"Cabaret\". The show toured and also appeared on Broadway. She then did \"The Vagina Monologues\" in L.A. She had a stint in a dramatic role as a Chief Deputy Assistant District Attorney, \"Camille Paris\", on For the People (2002). Thompson has starred in more than 30 films, 25 television movies, 4 television series, more than 20 ballets, and starred on Broadway in \"Cabaret\". Lea can currently be seen on ABC Family\'s Peabody Award winning hit show \"Switched at Birth,\" where she acts and directs. Lea\'s movie credits include: \"All the Right Moves,\" \"Red Dawn,\" \"Some Kind of Wonderful,\" \"The Beverly Hillbillies,\" \"Howard The Duck\"(star and vocals), Clint Eastwood\'s \"J. Edgar;\" the 2014 Sundance favorite \"Ping Pong Summer;\" and soon to be released \"Left Behind\" starring Nicolas Cage.Lea lives in Los Angeles with her husband of twenty-five years, film/television director Howard Deutch, and their two talented daughters, Madelyn and Zoey, along with many dogs, fish, horses, chickens, a cat, tortoise, and parrot. She supports and often performs for breast cancer, mental health, and Alzheimer\'s charities. Lea is currently in pre-production on \"The Year of Spectacular Men\", a film written by her daughter Madelyn Deutch, and is writing her first book of essays.

Later she and her mother, along with her three older sisters, moved to Richmond, where Leslie attended an all-girls Catholic high school, St. Gertrude.In 1990 The Oprah Winfrey Show (1986) and the Elite Agency held a nationwide modeling search; Leslie\'s mother took photos of her then 16-year-old daughter and sent them in. Although Leslie wasn\'t impressed with the photos, the judges--John Casablancas, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Iman--were, and they picked her as the winner.After finishing her junior year, Leslie flew to New York City and signed a contract with Elite. She modeled over the summer, and went on a trip to Japan. She returned home for her senior year and graduated in 1992, then decided to forgo a full-time modeling career to attend the University of Virginia. After a single semester, however, she dropped out and moved to New York City. She attended the William Esper acting studio for three years and took nine months off in which she did more modeling in Europe. Her photographs have appeared in such magazine as Maxim and FHM.Leslie had her first film role in the comedy Private Parts (1997), which was followed by her first television series (where she replaced the departed Susan Walters as the female lead) in the second season of The Big Easy (1996) on USA. Unfortunately, the show was canceled just months later.In 1999 she appeared as the lead character on the WB Network television series Popular (1999). The show was a success among teenagers, and led Leslie to more recognizable film roles, such as The Skulls (2000) and See Spot Run (2001).

Hugo has an older brother, Simon, and a younger sister, Anna, who both also live and work in Australia. During his early childhood, the Weaving family spent most of their time traveling between Nigeria, Great Britain, and Australia. This was due to the cross-country demands of his father\'s job in the computer industry. Later, during his teens, Hugo spent three years in England in the seventies attending Queen Elizabeth\'s Hospital School in Bristol. There, he showed early promise in theater productions and also excelled at history, achieving an A in his O-level examination. He arrived permanently in Australia in 1976 and finished his education at Knox Grammar School, Sydney. He graduated from NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art), a college well-known for other alumni such as Mel Gibson and Geoffrey Rush, in 1981. Since then, Hugo has had a steadily successful career in the film, television, and theater industries. However, he has illustrated that, as renowned as he is known for his film work, he feels most at home on stage and continually performs in Australian theater productions, usually with the Sydney Theater Company. With his success has also come extensive recognition. He has won numerous awards, including two Australian Film Institute Awards (AFI) for Best Actor in a Leading Role and three total nominations. The AFI is the Australian equivalent of an Academy Award, and Hugo won for his performances in Proof (1991) and The Interview (1998). He was also nominated for his performance in Пригоди Прiсцилли, королеви пустелi (1994). He garnered the Best Acting prize for The Interview (1998) at the Montreal Film Festival in 1998 in addition to his AFI Award and, that same year, won the Australian Star of the Year. More recently, roles in films such as The Matrix trilogy as Agent Smith and The Lord of the Rings trilogy as Lord Elrond have considerably raised his international profile. His famous and irreplaceable role in The Matrix movies have made him one of the greatest sci-fi villains of the Twenty-first Century. With each new film, television, or theatrical role, Hugo continues to surpass his audience\'s expectations and remains one of the most versatile performers working today. He resides in Australia and has two children with partner Katrina Greenwood. Though Hugo and Katrina have never married, they\'ve been a committed couple for over 25 years; while Hugo was quoted as saying marriage \"petrified\" him in the 1990s, by middle of the following decade he said he no longer felt that way, and that he and Katrina have toyed with the idea of marrying \"when we\'re really old\".'),(628,'Wes Bentley','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgyOTY5OTA5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM1MjM1Nw@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1978-09-04','Wes Bentley is an American actor who first became well-known via his role in the Oscar-winning film Краса по-американськи (1999), in which he played the soulful, artistic next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts.

She is the daughter of Didi (Radford), a former flight attendant, and Monty Silverstone, a real estate investor. Her English-born father is from a Jewish family, while her Scottish-born mother converted to Judaism. Alicia\'s career began at the tender age of six, when her father took some photos of his young daughter, which eventually led to her getting several television commercials. After a guest spot on The Wonder Years (1988) as a literal \"dream girl\", she moved on to movies. She landed a role in The Crush (1993), a sort of Фатальний потяг (1987) for teenagers in which she portrayed a disturbed young girl obsessed with an older man. The nasty little role did not impress the critical establishment but it wowed its target audience: teenagers. In fact, the role won her the 1994 MTV Movie Award for \"Best Villain\" and \"Breakthrough Performance\". It is interesting to note that during the filming of the movie, Alicia became an emancipated minor in order to get around child labor laws which would have interfered with her working hours. She was a dedicated actress from early on.The film also caught the attention of Aerosmith, who hired her to appear in a string of their music videos. The first of them, \"Cryin\'\", was voted the #1 video of all time on MTV. Silverstone was definitely a hit with the MTV crowd, but larger commercial success still eluded her. That all changed when she landed the role of Cher in Amy Heckerling\'s Безголовi (1995). Cher was the antithesis of Alicia\'s role in The Crush; this time around, she was a rich, naive yet endearing girl from Beverly Hills in search of love in the 1990s. The film was a huge box-office hit and wowed both audiences and critics alike and demonstrated Alicia\'s strength and bankability. She was hailed as the woman of the hour, and branded the spokeswoman for an emerging young generation. She signed a deal with Columbia TriStar worth $10 million and got the coveted role of Batgirl in the Batman franchise. Also, as part of the package, she received a three-year first-look deal for her own production company, First Kiss Productions.

As a toddler, she was already a compulsive performer, re-enacting TV commercials for her family\'s amusement, but she decided to focus her energies on dance. After studying classical ballet for nine years at Spain\'s National Conservatory, she continued her training under a series of prominent dancers. At 15, however, she heeded her true calling when she bested more than 300 other girls at a talent agency audition. The resulting contract landed her several roles in Spanish TV shows and music videos, which in turn paved the way for a career on the big screen. Cruz made her movie debut in El laberinto griego (1993) (The Greek Labyrinth), then appeared briefly in the Timothy Dalton thriller Framed (1992). Her third film was the Oscar-winning Прекрасна епоха (1992), in which she played one of four sisters vying for the love of a handsome army deserter. The film also garnered several Goyas, the Spanish equivalent of the Academy Awards. Her resume continued to grow by three or four films each year, and soon Cruz was a leading lady of Spanish cinema. Carne trémula (1997) (Live Flesh) offered her the chance to work with renowned Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar (who would later be her ticket to international fame), and the same year she was the lead actress in the thriller/drama/mystery/sci-fi film Розплющ очi (1997), a huge hit in Spain that earned eight Goyas (though none for Cruz). Her luck finally changed in 1998, when the movie-industry comedy La niña de tus ojos (1998) won her a Best Actress Goya. Cruz made a few more forays into English-language film, but her first big international hit was Almodóvar\'s Все про мою матiр (1999), in which she played an unchaste but well-meaning nun. As the film was showered with awards and accolades, Cruz suddenly found herself in demand on both sides of the Atlantic. Her next big project was Woman on Top (2000), an American comedy about a chef with bewitching culinary skills and a severe case of motion sickness. While in the US, she also signed up to star opposite Johnny Depp in the drug-trafficking drama Кокаiн (2001) and opposite Matt Damon in Billy Bob Thornton\'s All the Pretty Horses (2000). Cruz says she\'s wary of being typecast as a beautiful young damsel, but it\'s hard to imagine disguising her wide-eyed charms and generous nature.

The same year, Josh was cast in the pilot, Becoming Glen (2002), but Fox did not order it to series (though, several years later, it was reconfigured as the short-lived series, The Winner (2007), starring Rob Corddry, and co-written/produced by Seth MacFarlane). Toward the end of 2002, Josh appeared on an episode of Швидка допомога (1994).Josh made his big-screen debut, in 2003, with a bit part in the Oscar-nominated American Splendor (2003). His career began its measured ascent in 2005 with a supporting slot as one of Will Ferrell\'s kids in Kicking & Screaming (2005), a co-starring role in the indie hit Little Manhattan (2005), and another co-starring role in Затура (2005), which was originally conceived as a sequel to Джуманджi (1995). Despite underperforming at the box office, \"Zathura\" helped earned for Josh his first Young Artist Award for \"Leading Young Actor\".2006 saw bigger returns for Josh\'s burgeoning film career with a role as one of Robin Williams\' sons in the modest hit, Дурдом на колесах (2006). The following year, he landed his first breakthrough role in Мiст у Терабiтiю (2007), the kid-approved adaptation of Katherine Paterson\'s novel that co-starred AnnaSophia Robb, whose career was also taking off at this time.Josh starred as Brendan Fraser\'s nephew in another family-film hit, Подорож до центру Землi (2008), and he had a smaller role in the Crash-like drama, Fragments (2008), though by now his face and name were being used in movie-marketing materials.

The film received several awards and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture.

Forbes named her as one of the handful of entertainment stars on their list of 30 under 30 who are \"reinventing the world\" (a list of the brightest stars of the future). Noting that Suburgatory (2011) was \"one of the big hits of the new [TV] season\" and that Levy would be seen in two upcoming films, Forbes called her \"one to watch\". Levy appeared in two films in 2012, Fun Size (2012) and Nobody Walks (2012). Released before Halloween, Fun Size (2012) co-starred Victoria Justice and comedian Chelsea Handler. While filming it, Levy was disappointed that she failed to meet co-star Johnny Knoxville, as he was on set for the one week of shooting that she was not.

His father was an officer in the Royal Engineers and the family followed him as his career posted him throughout the United Kingdom and Europe before they eventually returned to Teesside. Scott wanted to join the Royal Army (his elder brother Frank had already joined the Merchant Navy) but his father encouraged him to develop his artistic talents instead and so he went to West Hartlepool College of Art and then London\'s Royal College of Art where he helped found the film department.In 1962, he joined the BBC as a trainee set designer working on several high profile series. He attended a trainee director\'s course while he was there and his first directing job was on an episode of the popular BBC police series Z Cars (1962), Z Cars: Error of Judgement (1965). More TV work followed until, frustrated by the poor financial rewards at the BBC, he went into advertising. With his younger brother, Tony Scott, he formed the advertising production company RSA (Ridley Scott Associates) in 1967 and spent the next 10 years making some of the best known and best loved TV adverts ever shown on British television, including a series of ads for Hovis bread set to the music of Dvorak\'s New World Symphony which are still talked about today (\"\'e were a great baker were our dad.\")He began working with producer David Puttnam in the 1970s developing ideas for feature films. Their first joint endeavor, Дуелянти (1977) won the Jury Prize for Best First Work at Cannes in 1977 and was nominated for the Palm d\'Or, more than successfully launching Scott\'s feature film career. The success of Зорянi вiйни: Епiзод 4 - Нова надiя (1977) inspired Scott\'s interest in making science fiction and he accepted the offer to direct Dan O\'Bannon\'s low budget science fiction horror movie Чужий (1979), a critical and commercial success that firmly established his worldwide reputation as a movie director.Той, хто бiжить по лезу (1982) followed in 1982 to, at best, a lukewarm reception from public and critics but in the years that followed, its reputation grew - and Scott\'s with it - as one of the most important sci-fi movies ever made. Scott\'s next major project was back in the advertising world where he created another of the most talked-about advertising spots in broadcast history when his \"1984\"-inspired ad for the new Apple Macintosh computer was aired during the Super Bowl on January 22, 1984. Scott\'s movie career has seen a few flops (notably Легенда (1985) and 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992)), but with successes like Тельма i Луiiза (1991), Гладiатор (2000) and Падiння чорного яструба (2001) to offset them, his reputation remains solidly intact.Ridley Scott was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire at the 2003 Queen\'s New Year Honours for his \"substantial contribution to the British film industry\". On July 3, 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship in 2018. BAFTA described him as \"a visionary director, one of the great British film-makers whose work has made an indelible mark on the history of cinema. Forty years since his directorial debut, his films continue to cross the boundaries of style and genre, engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of film talent.\"'),(642,'Jude Law','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwOTg5NTQ3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM3MDAzNQ@@._V1_UY317_CR6,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1972-12-29','Jude Law is an English actor.

His movie acting debut was a very small role in the film A Man of No Importance (1994), where his simple cast credit is as \"First Young Man\". His first lead role was in the film The Disappearance of Finbar (1996). During a 6-month postponement in production, he returned home to Cork and there received a call about the film Майкл Коллiнз (1996).

He is the eldest of six children. Four of his siblings are also in the arts: Martha Fiennes, a director; Magnus Fiennes, a musician; Sophie Fiennes, a producer; and Joseph Fiennes, an actor. He is of English, Irish, and Scottish origin.A noted Shakespeare interpreter, he first achieved success onstage at the Royal National Theatre. Fiennes first worked on screen in 1990 and then made his film debut in 1992 as Heathcliff in Emily Brontë\'s Wuthering Heights (1992), opposite Juliette Binoche. 1993 was his \"breakout year\". He had a major role in the controversial Peter Greenaway film The Baby of Mâcon (1993), with Julia Ormond, which was poorly received. Later that year he became known internationally for portraying the amoral Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth in Steven Spielberg\'s Список Шиндлера (1993). For this he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. He did not win, but did win the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for the role, as well as Best Supporting Actor honors from numerous critics groups, including the National Society of Film Critics, and the New York, Chicago, Boston, and London Film Critics associations. His portrayal as Göth also earned him a spot on the American Film Institute\'s list of Top 50 Film Villains. To look suitable to represent Goeth, Fiennes gained weight, but he managed to shed it afterwards. In 1994, he portrayed American academic Charles Van Doren in Quiz Show (1994). In 1996, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Count Almásy the World War II epic romance, and another Best Picture winner, Anthony Minghella\'s Англiйський пацiент (1996), in which he starred with Kristin Scott Thomas. He also received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations, as well as two Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award nominations, one for Best Actor and another shared with the film\'s ensemble cast.Since then, Fiennes has been in a number of notable films, including Дивнi днi (1995), Oscar and Lucinda (1997), the animated Принц Eгипту (1998), István Szabó\'s Sunshine (1999), Neil Jordan-directed films The End of the Affair (1999) and The Good Thief (2002), Червоний дракон (2002), Maid in Manhattan (2002), Вiдданий садiвник (2005), Залягти на дно в Брюге (2008), Читець (2008), co-starring Kate Winslet, Kathryn Bigelow\'s Oscar®-winning Володар Бурi (2008), Битва титанiв (2010), Mike Newell\'s screen adaptation of Charles Dickens\'Великi надii (2012), with Helena Bonham Carter and Jeremy Irvine, and Wes Anderson\'s Готель Гранд Будапешт (2014).He is also known for his roles in major film franchises such as the Harry Potter film series (2005-2011), in which he played the evil Lord Voldemort. His nephew, Hero Fiennes Tiffin played Tom Riddle, the young Lord Voldemort, in Гаррi Поттер та напiвкровний принц (2009). Ralph also appears in the James Bond series, in which he has played M, starting with the 2012 film 007: Координати Скайфолл (2012).In 2011, Fiennes made his directorial debut with his film adaptation of Shakespeare\'s tragedy political thriller Корiолан (2011), in which he also played the title character, opposite Gerard Butler and Vanessa Redgrave. Fiennes has won a Tony Award for playing Prince Hamlet on Broadway.In 2015, Fiennes played a music producer in Luca Guadagnino\'s Великий сплеск (2015), starring opposite Tilda Swinton and Matthias Schoenaerts, and in 2016, Fiennes starred in Joel and Ethan Coen\'s Аве, Цезар! (2016).Since 1999, Fiennes has served as an ambassador for UNICEF UK.'),(655,'Stanley Kubrick','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMzAwMzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjc4ODQ2._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Stanley Kubrick was born in Manhattan, New York City, to Sadie Gertrude (Perveler) and Jacob Leonard Kubrick, a physician. His family were Jewish immigrants (from Austria, Romania, and Russia). Stanley was considered intelligent, despite poor grades at school. Hoping that a change of scenery would produce better academic performance, Kubrick\'s father sent him in 1940 to Pasadena, California, to stay with his uncle, Martin Perveler. Returning to the Bronx in 1941 for his last year of grammar school, there seemed to be little change in his attitude or his results. Hoping to find something to interest his son, Jack introduced Stanley to chess, with the desired result. Kubrick took to the game passionately, and quickly became a skilled player. Chess would become an important device for Kubrick in later years, often as a tool for dealing with recalcitrant actors, but also as an artistic motif in his films.Jack Kubrick\'s decision to give his son a camera for his thirteenth birthday would be an even wiser move: Kubrick became an avid photographer, and would often make trips around New York taking photographs which he would develop in a friend\'s darkroom. After selling an unsolicited photograph to Look Magazine, Kubrick began to associate with their staff photographers, and at the age of seventeen was offered a job as an apprentice photographer.In the next few years, Kubrick had regular assignments for \"Look\", and would become a voracious movie-goer. Together with friend Alexander Singer, Kubrick planned a move into film, and in 1950 sank his savings into making the documentary Day of the Fight (1951). This was followed by several short commissioned documentaries (Flying Padre (1951), and (The Seafarers (1953), but by attracting investors and hustling chess games in Central Park, Kubrick was able to make Fear and Desire (1953) in California.Filming this movie was not a happy experience; Kubrick\'s marriage to high school sweetheart Toba Metz did not survive the shooting. Despite mixed reviews for the film itself, Kubrick received good notices for his obvious directorial talents. Kubrick\'s next two films Killer\'s Kiss (1955) and Убивство (1956) brought him to the attention of Hollywood, and in 1957 he directed Kirk Douglas in Шляхи слави (1957). Douglas later called upon Kubrick to take over the production of Спартак (1960), by some accounts hoping that Kubrick would be daunted by the scale of the project and would thus be accommodating. This was not the case, however: Kubrick took charge of the project, imposing his ideas and standards on the film. Many crew members were upset by his style: cinematographer Russell Metty complained to producers that Kubrick was taking over his job. Kubrick\'s response was to tell him to sit there and do nothing. Metty complied, and ironically was awarded the Academy Award for his cinematography.Kubrick\'s next project was to direct Marlon Brando in One-Eyed Jacks (1961), but negotiations broke down and Brando himself ended up directing the film himself. Disenchanted with Hollywood and after another failed marriage, Kubrick moved permanently to England, from where he would make all of his subsequent films. Despite having obtained a pilot\'s license, Kubrick was rumored to be afraid of flying.Kubrick\'s first UK film was Лолiта (1962), which was carefully constructed and guided so as to not offend the censorship boards which at the time had the power to severely damage the commercial success of a film. Доктор Стрейнджлав, або Як я перестав хвилюватись i полюбив бомбу (1964) was a big risk for Kubrick; before this, \"nuclear\" was not considered a subject for comedy. Originally written as a drama, Kubrick decided that too many of the ideas he had written were just too funny to be taken seriously. The film\'s critical and commercial success allowed Kubrick the financial and artistic freedom to work on any project he desired. Around this time, Kubrick\'s focus diversified and he would always have several projects in various stages of development: \"Blue Moon\" (a story about Hollywood\'s first pornographic feature film), \"Napoleon\" (an epic historical biography, abandoned after studio losses on similar projects), \"Wartime Lies\" (based on the novel by Louis Begley), and \"Rhapsody\" (a psycho-sexual thriller).The next film he completed was a collaboration with sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke. 2001: Космiчна Одiссея (1968) is hailed by many as the best ever made; an instant cult favorite, it has set the standard and tone for many science fiction films that followed. Kubrick followed this with Механiчний апельсин (1971), which rivaled Лолiта (1962) for the controversy it generated - this time not only for its portrayal of sex, but also of violence. Баррi Лiндон (1975) would prove a turning point in both his professional and private lives. His unrelenting demands of commitment and perfection of cast and crew had by now become legendary. Actors would be required to perform dozens of takes with no breaks. Filming a story in Ireland involving military, Kubrick received reports that the IRA had declared him a possible target. Production was promptly moved out of the country, and Kubrick\'s desire for privacy and security resulted in him being considered a recluse ever since.Having turned down directing a sequel to Той, що виганяe диявола (1973), Kubrick made his own horror film: Сяйво (1980). Again, rumors circulated of demands made upon actors and crew. Stephen King (whose novel the film was based upon) reportedly didn\'t like Kubrick\'s adaptation (indeed, he would later write his own screenplay which was filmed as Сяйво (1997).)Kubrick\'s subsequent work has been well spaced: it was seven years before Цiлiсно-металева оболонка (1987) was released. By this time, Kubrick was married with children and had extensively remodeled his house. Seen by one critic as the dark side to the humanist story of Взвод (1986), Цiлiсно-металева оболонка (1987) continued Kubrick\'s legacy of solid critical acclaim, and profit at the box office.In the 1990s, Kubrick began an on-again/off-again collaboration with Brian Aldiss on a new science fiction film called \"Artificial Intelligence (AI)\", but progress was very slow, and was backgrounded until special effects technology was up to the standard the Kubrick wanted.Kubrick returned to his in-development projects, but encountered a number of problems: \"Napoleon\" was completely dead, and \"Wartime Lies\" (now called \"The Aryan Papers\") was abandoned when Steven Spielberg announced he would direct Список Шиндлера (1993), which covered much of the same material.While pre-production work on \"AI\" crawled along, Kubrick combined \"Rhapsody\" and \"Blue Movie\" and officially announced his next project as Iз широко заплющеними очима (1999), starring the then-married Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. After two years of production under unprecedented security and privacy, the film was released to a typically polarized critical and public reception; Kubrick claimed it was his best film to date.Special effects technology had matured rapidly in the meantime, and Kubrick immediately began active work on Штучний розум (2001), but tragically suffered a fatal heart attack in his sleep on March 7th, 1999.After Kubrick\'s death, Spielberg revealed that the two of them were friends that frequently communicated discreetly about the art of filmmaking; both had a large degree of mutual respect for each other\'s work. \"AI\" was frequently discussed; Kubrick even suggested that Spielberg should direct it as it was more his type of project. Based on this relationship, Spielberg took over as the film\'s director and completed the last Kubrick project.How much of Kubrick\'s vision remains in the finished project -- and what he would think of the film as eventually released -- will be the final great unanswerable mysteries in the life of this talented and private filmmaker.'),(656,'Marlon Brando','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MDYyMDE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgyNTEzNA@@._V1_UY317_CR97,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Marlon Brando is widely considered the greatest movie actor of all time, rivaled only by the more theatrically oriented Laurence Olivier in terms of esteem. Unlike Olivier, who preferred the stage to the screen, Brando concentrated his talents on movies after bidding the Broadway stage adieu in 1949, a decision for which he was severely criticized when his star began to dim in the 1960s and he was excoriated for squandering his talents. No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on succeeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years after he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie version of Tennessee Williams\' Трамвай \'Бажання\' (1951) and a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola\'s Апокалiпсис наших днiв (1979), all American actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was Brando. It was if the shadow of John Barrymore, the great American actor closest to Brando in terms of talent and stardom, dominated the acting field up until the 1970s. He did not, nor did any other actor so dominate the public\'s consciousness of what WAS an actor before or since Brando\'s 1951 on-screen portrayal of Stanley made him a cultural icon. Brando eclipsed the reputation of other great actors circa 1950, such as Paul Muni and Fredric March. Only the luster of Spencer Tracy\'s reputation hasn\'t dimmed when seen in the starlight thrown off by Brando. However, neither Tracy nor Olivier created an entire school of acting just by the force of his personality. Brando did.Marlon Brando, Jr. was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Marlon Brando, Sr., a calcium carbonate salesman, and his artistically inclined wife, the former Dorothy Julia Pennebaker. \"Bud\" Brando was one of three children. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, Dutch, French Huguenot, Welsh, and Scottish; his surname originated with a distant German immigrant ancestor named \"Brandau.\" His oldest sister Jocelyn Brando was also an actress, taking after their mother, who engaged in amateur theatricals and mentored a then-unknown Henry Fonda, another Nebraska native, in her role as director of the Omaha Community Playhouse. Frannie, Brando\'s other sibling, was a visual artist. Both Brando sisters contrived to leave the Midwest for New York City, Jocelyn to study acting and Frannie to study art. Marlon managed to escape the vocational doldrums forecast for him by his cold, distant father and his disapproving schoolteachers by striking out for The Big Apple in 1943, following Jocelyn into the acting profession. Acting was the only thing he was good at, for which he received praise, so he was determined to make it his career - a high-school dropout, he had nothing else to fall back on, having been rejected by the military due to a knee injury he incurred playing football at Shattuck Military Academy, Brando Sr.\'s alma mater. The school booted Marlon out as incorrigible before graduation.Acting was a skill he honed as a child, the lonely son of alcoholic parents. With his father away on the road, and his mother frequently intoxicated to the point of stupefaction, the young Bud would play-act for her to draw her out of her stupor and to attract her attention and love. His mother was exceedingly neglectful, but he loved her, particularly for instilling in him a love of nature, a feeling which informed his character Paul in Останнe танго в Парижi (1972) (\"Last Tango in Paris\") when he is recalling his childhood for his young lover Jeanne. \"I don\'t have many good memories,\" Paul confesses, and neither did Brando of his childhood. Sometimes he had to go down to the town jail to pick up his mother after she had spent the night in the drunk tank and bring her home, events that traumatized the young boy but may have been the grain that irritated the oyster of his talent, producing the pearls of his performances. Anthony Quinn, his Oscar-winning co-star in Viva Zapata! (1952) told Brando\'s first wife Anna Kashfi, \"I admire Marlon\'s talent, but I don\'t envy the pain that created it.\"Brando enrolled in Erwin Piscator\'s Dramatic Workshop at New York\'s New School, and was mentored by Stella Adler, a member of a famous Yiddish Theatre acting family. Adler helped introduce to the New York stage the \"emotional memory\" technique of Russian theatrical actor, director and impresario Konstantin Stanislavski, whose motto was \"Think of your own experiences and use them truthfully.\" The results of this meeting between an actor and the teacher preparing him for a life in the theater would mark a watershed in American acting and culture.Brando made his debut on the boards of Broadway on October 19, 1944, in \"I Remember Mama,\" a great success. As a young Broadway actor, Brando was invited by talent scouts from several different studios to screen-test for them, but he turned them down because he would not let himself be bound by the then-standard seven-year contract. Brando would make his film debut quite some time later in Fred Zinnemann\'s The Men (1950) for producer Stanley Kramer. Playing a paraplegic soldier, Brando brought new levels of realism to the screen, expanding on the verisimilitude brought to movies by Group Theatre alumni John Garfield, the predecessor closest to him in the raw power he projected on-screen. Ironically, it was Garfield whom producer Irene Mayer Selznick had chosen to play the lead in a new Tennessee Williams play she was about to produce, but negotiations broke down when Garfield demanded an ownership stake in \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" Burt Lancaster was next approached, but couldn\'t get out of a prior film commitment. Then director Elia Kazan suggested Brando, whom he had directed to great effect in Maxwell Anderson\'s play \"Truckline Café,\" in which Brando co-starred with Karl Malden, who was to remain a close friend for the next 60 years.During the production of \"Truckline Café,\" Kazan had found that Brando\'s presence was so magnetic, he had to re-block the play to keep Marlon near other major characters\' stage business, as the audience could not take its eyes off of him. For the scene where Brando\'s character re-enters the stage after killing his wife, Kazan placed him upstage-center, partially obscured by scenery, but where the audience could still see him as Karl Malden and others played out their scene within the café set. When he eventually entered the scene, crying, the effect was electric. A young Pauline Kael, arriving late to the play, had to avert her eyes when Brando made this entrance as she believed the young actor on stage was having a real-life conniption. She did not look back until her escort commented that the young man was a great actor.The problem with casting Brando as Stanley was that he was much younger than the character as written by Williams. However, after a meeting between Brando and Williams, the playwright eagerly agreed that Brando would make an ideal Stanley. Williams believed that by casting a younger actor, the Neanderthalish Kowalski would evolve from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to his youthful ignorance. Brando ultimately was dissatisfied with his performance, though, saying he never was able to bring out the humor of the character, which was ironic as his characterization often drew laughs from the audience at the expense of Jessica Tandy\'s Blanche Dubois. During the out-of-town tryouts, Kazan realized that Brando\'s magnetism was attracting attention and audience sympathy away from Blanche to Stanley, which was not what the playwright intended. The audience\'s sympathy should be solely with Blanche, but many spectators were identifying with Stanley. Kazan queried Williams on the matter, broaching the idea of a slight rewrite to tip the scales back to more of a balance between Stanley and Blanche, but Williams demurred, smitten as he was by Brando, just like the preview audiences.For his part, Brando believed that the audience sided with his Stanley because Jessica Tandy was too shrill. He thought Vivien Leigh, who played the part in the movie, was ideal, as she was not only a great beauty but she WAS Blanche Dubois, troubled as she was in her real life by mental illness and nymphomania. Brando\'s appearance as Stanley on stage and on screen revolutionized American acting by introducing \"The Method\" into American consciousness and culture. Method acting, rooted in Adler\'s study at the Moscow Art Theatre of Stanislavsky\'s theories that she subsequently introduced to the Group Theatre, was a more naturalistic style of performing, as it engendered a close identification of the actor with the character\'s emotions. Adler took first place among Brando\'s acting teachers, and socially she helped turn him from an unsophisticated Midwestern farm boy into a knowledgeable and cosmopolitan artist who one day would socialize with presidents.Brando didn\'t like the term \"The Method,\" which quickly became the prominent paradigm taught by such acting gurus as Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Brando denounced Strasberg in his autobiography \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\" (1994), saying that he was a talentless exploiter who claimed he had been Brando\'s mentor. The Actors Studio had been founded by Strasberg along with Kazan and Stella Adler\'s husband, Harold Clurman, all Group Theatre alumni, all political progressives deeply committed to the didactic function of the stage. Brando credits his knowledge of the craft to Adler and Kazan, while Kazan in his autobiography \"A Life\" claimed that Brando\'s genius thrived due to the thorough training Adler had given him. Adler\'s method emphasized that authenticity in acting is achieved by drawing on inner reality to expose deep emotional experienceInterestingly, Elia Kazan believed that Brando had ruined two generations of actors, his contemporaries and those who came after him, all wanting to emulate the great Brando by employing The Method. Kazan felt that Brando was never a Method actor, that he had been highly trained by Adler and did not rely on gut instincts for his performances, as was commonly believed. Many a young actor, mistaken about the true roots of Brando\'s genius, thought that all it took was to find a character\'s motivation, empathize with the character through sense and memory association, and regurgitate it all on stage to become the character. That\'s not how the superbly trained Brando did it; he could, for example, play accents, whereas your average American Method actor could not. There was a method to Brando\'s art, Kazan felt, but it was not The Method.After Трамвай \'Бажання\' (1951), for which he received the first of his eight Academy Award nominations, Brando appeared in a string of Academy Award-nominated performances - in Viva Zapata! (1952), Julius Caesar (1953) and the summit of his early career, Kazan\'s У порту (1954). For his \"Waterfront\" portrayal of meat-headed longshoreman Terry Malloy, the washed-up pug who \"coulda been a contender,\" Brando won his first Oscar. Along with his iconic performance as the rebel-without-a-cause Johnny in The Wild One (1953) (\"What are you rebelling against?\" Johnny is asked. \"What have ya got?\" is his reply), the first wave of his career was, according to Jon Voight, unprecedented in its audacious presentation of such a wide range of great acting. Director John Huston said his performance of Marc Antony was like seeing the door of a furnace opened in a dark room, and co-star John Gielgud, the premier Shakespearean actor of the 20th century, invited Brando to join his repertory company.It was this period of 1951-54 that revolutionized American acting, spawning such imitators as James Dean - who modeled his acting and even his lifestyle on his hero Brando - the young Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. After Brando, every up-and-coming star with true acting talent and a brooding, alienated quality would be hailed as the \"New Brando,\" such as Warren Beatty in Kazan\'s Splendor in the Grass (1961). \"We are all Brando\'s children,\" Jack Nicholson pointed out in 1972. \"He gave us our freedom.\" He was truly \"The Godfather\" of American acting - and he was just 30 years old. Though he had a couple of failures, like Désirée (1954) and The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956), he was clearly miscast in them and hadn\'t sought out the parts so largely escaped blame.In the second period of his career, 1955-62, Brando managed to uniquely establish himself as a great actor who also was a Top 10 movie star, although that star began to dim after the box-office high point of his early career, Sayonara (1957) (for which he received his fifth Best Actor Oscar nomination). Brando tried his hand at directing a film, the well-reviewed One-Eyed Jacks (1961) that he made for his own production company, Pennebaker Productions (after his mother\'s maiden name). Stanley Kubrick had been hired to direct the film, but after months of script rewrites in which Brando participated, Kubrick and Brando had a falling out and Kubrick was sacked. According to his widow Christiane Kubrick, Stanley believed that Brando had wanted to direct the film himself all along.Tales proliferated about the profligacy of Brando the director, burning up a million and a half feet of expensive VistaVision film at 50 cents a foot, fully ten times the normal amount of raw stock expended during production of an equivalent motion picture. Brando took so long editing the film that he was never able to present the studio with a cut. Paramount took it away from him and tacked on a re-shot ending that Brando was dissatisfied with, as it made the Oedipal figure of Dad Longworth into a villain. In any normal film Dad would have been the heavy, but Brando believed that no one was innately evil, that it was a matter of an individual responding to, and being molded by, one\'s environment. It was not a black-and-white world, Brando felt, but a gray world in which once-decent people could do horrible things. This attitude explains his sympathetic portrayal of Nazi officer Christian Diestl in the film he made before shooting One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Edward Dmytryk\'s filming of Irwin Shaw\'s novel The Young Lions (1958). Shaw denounced Brando\'s performance, but audiences obviously disagreed, as the film was a major hit. It would be the last hit movie Brando would have for more than a decade.One-Eyed Jacks (1961) generated respectable numbers at the box office, but the production costs were exorbitant - a then-staggering $6 million - which made it run a deficit. A film essentially is \"made\" in the editing room, and Brando found cutting to be a terribly boring process, which was why the studio eventually took the film away from him. Despite his proved talent in handling actors and a large production, Brando never again directed another film, though he would claim that all actors essentially direct themselves during the shooting of a picture.Between the production and release of One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Brando appeared in Sidney Lumet\'s film version of Tennessee Williams\' play \"Orpheus Descending,\" The Fugitive Kind (1960) which teamed him with fellow Oscar winners Anna Magnani and Joanne Woodward. Following in Elizabeth Taylor\'s trailblazing footsteps, Brando became the second performer to receive a $1-million salary for a motion picture, so high were the expectations for this re-teaming of Kowalski and his creator (in 1961 critic Hollis Alpert had published a book \"Brando and the Shadow of Stanley Kowalski\"). Critics and audiences waiting for another incendiary display from Brando in a Williams work were disappointed when the renamed The Fugitive Kind (1960) finally released. Though Tennessee was hot, with movie versions of Кiшка на розпеченому даху (1958) and Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) burning up the box office and receiving kudos from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, The Fugitive Kind (1960) was a failure. This was followed by the so-so box-office reception of One-Eyed Jacks (1961) in 1961 and then by a failure of a more monumental kind: Заколот на Баунтi (1962), a remake of the famed 1935 film.Brando signed on to Заколот на Баунтi (1962) after turning down the lead in the David Lean classic Лоуренс Аравiйський (1962) because he didn\'t want to spend a year in the desert riding around on a camel. He received another $1-million salary, plus $200,000 in overages as the shoot went overtime and over budget. During principal photography, highly respected director Carol Reed (an eventual Academy Award winner) was fired, and his replacement, two-time Oscar winner Lewis Milestone, was shunted aside by Brando as Marlon basically took over the direction of the film himself. The long shoot became so notorious that President John F. Kennedy asked director Billy Wilder at a cocktail party not \"when\" but \"if\" the \"Bounty\" shoot would ever be over. The MGM remake of one of its classic Golden Age films garnered a Best Picture Oscar nomination and was one of the top grossing films of 1962, yet failed to go into the black due to its Brobdingnagian budget estimated at $20 million, which is equivalent to $120 million when adjusted for inflation.Brando and Taylor, whose Клеопатра (1963) nearly bankrupted 20th Century-Fox due to its huge cost overruns (its final budget was more than twice that of Brando\'s Заколот на Баунтi (1962)), were pilloried by the show business press for being the epitome of the pampered, self-indulgent stars who were ruining the industry. Seeking scapegoats, the Hollywood press conveniently ignored the financial pressures on the studios. The studios had been hurt by television and by the antitrust-mandated divestiture of their movie theater chains, causing a large outflow of production to Italy and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s in order to lower costs. The studio bosses, seeking to replicate such blockbuster hits as the remakes of Десять заповiдей (1956) and Бен-Гур (1959), were the real culprits behind the losses generated by large-budgeted films that found it impossible to recoup their costs despite long lines at the box office.While Elizabeth Taylor, receiving the unwanted gift of reams of publicity from her adulterous romance with Клеопатра (1963) co-star Richard Burton, remained hot until the tanking of her own Tennessee Williams-renamed debacle Boom (1968), Brando from 1963 until the end of the decade appeared in one box-office failure after another as he worked out a contract he had signed with Universal Pictures. The industry had grown tired of Brando and his idiosyncrasies, though he continued to be offered prestige projects up through 1968.Some of the films Brando made in the 1960s were noble failures, such as The Ugly American (1963), The Appaloosa (1966) and Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967). For every \"Reflections,\" though, there seemed to be two or three outright debacles, such as Казка на нiч (1964), Morituri (1965), The Chase (1966), A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), Candy (1968), The Night of the Following Day (1969). By the time Brando began making the anti-colonialist picture Queimada (1969) in Colombia with Gillo Pontecorvo in the director\'s chair, he was box-office poison, despite having worked in the previous five years with such top directors as Arthur Penn, John Huston and the legendary Charles Chaplin, and with such top-drawer co-stars as David Niven, Yul Brynner, Sophia Loren and Taylor.The rap on Brando in the 1960s was that a great talent had ruined his potential to be America\'s answer to Laurence Olivier, as his friend William Redfield limned the dilemma in his book \"Letters from an Actor\" (1967), a memoir about Redfield\'s appearance in Burton\'s 1964 theatrical production of \"Hamlet.\" By failing to go back on stage and recharge his artistic batteries, something British actors such as Burton were not afraid to do, Brando had stifled his great talent, by refusing to tackle the classical repertoire and contemporary drama. Actors and critics had yearned for an American response to the high-acting style of the Brits, and while Method actors such as Rod Steiger tried to create an American style, they were hampered in their quest, as their king was lost in a wasteland of Hollywood movies that were beneath his talent. Many of his early supporters now turned on him, claiming he was a crass sellout.Despite evidence in such films as The Appaloosa (1966) and Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967) that Brando was in fact doing some of the best acting of his life, critics, perhaps with an eye on the box office, slammed him for failing to live up to, and nurture, his great gift. Brando\'s political activism, starting in the early 1960s with his championing of Native Americans\' rights, followed by his participation in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference\'s March on Washington in 1963, and followed by his appearance at a Black Panther rally in 1968, did not win him many admirers in the establishment. In fact, there was a de facto embargo on Brando films in the recently segregated (officially, at least) southeastern US in the 1960s. Southern exhibitors simply would not book his films, and producers took notice. After 1968, Brando would not work for three years.Pauline Kael wrote of Brando that he was Fortune\'s fool. She drew a parallel with the latter career of John Barrymore, a similarly gifted thespian with talents as prodigious, who seemingly threw them away. Brando, like the late-career Barrymore, had become a great ham, evidenced by his turn as the faux Indian guru in the egregious Candy (1968), seemingly because the material was so beneath his talent. Most observers of Brando in the 1960s believed that he needed to be reunited with his old mentor Elia Kazan, a relationship that had soured due to Kazan\'s friendly testimony naming names before the notorious House un-American Activities Committee. Perhaps Brando believed this, too, as he originally accepted an offer to appear as the star of Kazan\'s film adaptation of his own novel, The Arrangement (1969). However, after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Brando backed out of the film, telling Kazan that he could not appear in a Hollywood film after this tragedy. Also reportedly turning down a role opposite box-office king Paul Newman in a surefire script, Бутч Кессiдi та Санденс Кiд (1969), Brando decided to make Queimada (1969) with Pontecorvo. The film, a searing indictment of racism and colonialism, flopped at the box office but won the esteem of progressive critics and cultural arbiters such as Howard Zinn. He subsequently appeared in the British film The Nightcomers (1971), a prequel to \"Turn of the Screw\" and another critical and box office failure.Kazan, after a life in film and the theater, said that, aside from Orson Welles, whose greatness lay in film making, he only met one actor who was a genius: Brando. Richard Burton, an intellectual with a keen eye for observation if not for his own film projects, said that he found Brando to be very bright, unlike the public perception of him as a Terry Malloy-type character that he himself inadvertently promoted through his boorish behavior. Brando\'s problem, Burton felt, was that he was unique, and that he had gotten too much fame too soon at too early an age. Cut off from being nurtured by normal contact with society, fame had distorted Brando\'s personality and his ability to cope with the world, as he had not had time to grow up outside the limelight.Truman Capote, who eviscerated Brando in print in the mid-\'50s and had as much to do with the public perception of the dyslexic Brando as a dumbbell, always said that the best actors were ignorant, and that an intelligent person could not be a good actor. However, Brando was highly intelligent, and possessed of a rare genius in a then-deprecated art, acting. The problem that an intelligent performer has in movies is that it is the director, and not the actor, who has the power in his chosen field. Greatness in the other arts is defined by how much control the artist is able to exert over his chosen medium, but in movie acting, the medium is controlled by a person outside the individual artist. It is an axiom of the cinema that a performance, as is a film, is \"created\" in the cutting room, thus further removing the actor from control over his art. Brando had tried his hand at directing, in controlling the whole artistic enterprise, but he could not abide the cutting room, where a film and the film\'s performances are made. This lack of control over his art was the root of Brando\'s discontent with acting, with movies, and, eventually, with the whole wide world that invested so much cachet in movie actors, as long as \"they\" were at the top of the box-office charts. Hollywood was a matter of \"they\" and not the work, and Brando became disgusted.Charlton Heston, who participated in Martin Luther King\'s 1963 March on Washington with Brando, believes that Marlon was the great actor of his generation. However, noting a story that Brando had once refused a role in the early 1960s with the excuse \"How can I act when people are starving in India?,\" Heston believes that it was this attitude, the inability to separate one\'s idealism from one\'s work, that prevented Brando from reaching his potential. As Rod Steiger once said, Brando had it all, great stardom and a great talent. He could have taken his audience on a trip to the stars, but he simply would not. Steiger, one of Brando\'s children even though a contemporary, could not understand it. When James Mason\' was asked in 1971 who was the best American actor, he had replied that since Brando had let his career go belly-up, it had to be George C. Scott, by default.Paramount thought that only Laurence Olivier would suffice, but Lord Olivier was ill. The young director believed there was only one actor who could play godfather to the group of Young Turk actors he had assembled for his film, The Godfather of method acting himself - Marlon Brando. Francis Ford Coppola won the fight for Brando, Brando won - and refused - his second Oscar, and Paramount won a pot of gold by producing the then top-grossing film of all-time, Хрещений батько (1972), a gangster movie most critics now judge one of the greatest American films of all time. Brando followed his iconic portrayal of Don Corleone with his Oscar-nominated turn in the high-grossing and highly scandalous Останнe танго в Парижi (1972) (\"Last Tango in Paris\"), the first film dealing explicitly with sexuality in which an actor of Brando\'s stature had participated. He was now again a top ten box office star and once again heralded as the greatest actor of his generation, an unprecedented comeback that put him on the cover of \"Time\" magazine and would make him the highest-paid actor in the history of motion pictures by the end of the decade. Little did the world know that Brando, who had struggled through many projects in good faith during the 1960s, delivering some of his best acting, only to be excoriated and ignored as the films did not do well at the box office, essentially was through with the movies.After reaching the summit of his career, a rarefied atmosphere never reached before or since by any actor, Brando essentially walked away. He would give no more of himself after giving everything as he had done in Останнe танго в Парижi (1972),\" a performance that embarrassed him, according to his autobiography. Brando had come as close to any actor to being the \"auteur,\" or author, of a film, as the English-language scenes of \"Tango\" were created by encouraging Brando to improvise. The improvisations were written down and turned into a shooting script, and the scripted improvisations were shot the next day. Pauline Kael, the Brando of movie critics in that she was the most influential arbiter of cinematic quality of her generation and spawned a whole legion of Kael wannabes, said Brando\'s performance in Останнe танго в Парижi (1972) had revolutionized the art of film. Brando, who had to act to gain his mother\'s attention; Brando, who believed acting at best was nothing special as everyone in the world engaged in it every day of their lives to get what they wanted from other people; Brando, who believed acting at its worst was a childish charade and that movie stardom was a whorish fraud, would have agreed with Sam Peckinpah\'s summation of Pauline Kael: \"Pauline\'s a brilliant critic but sometimes she\'s just cracking walnuts with her ass.\" He probably would have done so in a simulacrum of those words, too.After another three-year hiatus, Brando took on just one more major role for the next 20 years, as the bounty hunter after Jack Nicholson in Arthur Penn\'s The Missouri Breaks (1976), a western that succeeded neither with the critics or at the box office. Following The Godfather and Tango, Brando\'s performance was disappointing for some reviewers, who accused him of giving an erratic and inconsistent performance. In 1977, Brando made a rare appearance on television in the miniseries Roots: The Next Generations (1979), portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni (1978), a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil.Later in his career, Brando concentrated on extracting the maximum amount of capital for the least amount of work from producers, as when he got the Salkind brothers to pony up a then-record $3.7 million against 10% of the gross for 13 days work on Superman (1978). Factoring in inflation, the straight salary for \"Superman\" equals or exceeds the new record of $1 million a day Harrison Ford set with К-19 (2002). He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie\'s sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage.Before cashing his first paycheck for Superman (1978), Brando had picked up $2 million for his extended cameo in Francis Ford Coppola\'s Апокалiпсис наших днiв (1979) in a role, that of Col. Kurtz, that he authored on-camera through improvisation while Coppola shot take after take. It was Brando\'s last bravura star performance. He co-starred with George C. Scott and John Gielgud in The Formula (1980), but the film was another critical and financial failure. Years later though, he did receive an eighth and final Oscar nomination for his supporting role in A Dry White Season (1989) after coming out of a near-decade-long retirement. Contrary to those who claimed he now only was in it for the money, Brando donated his entire seven-figure salary to an anti-apartheid charity. He then did an amusing performance in the comedy The Freshman (1990), winning rave reviews. He portrayed Tomas de Torquemada in the historical drama 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), but his performance was denounced and the film was another box office failure. He made another comeback in the Johnny Depp romantic drama Don Juan DeMarco (1994), which co-starred Faye Dunaway as his wife. He then appeared in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), co-starring Val Kilmer, who he didn\'t get along with. The filming was an unpleasant experience for Brando, as well as another critical and box office failure.Brando had first attracted media attention at the age of 24, when \"Life\" magazine ran a photo of himself and his sister Jocelyn, who were both then appearing on Broadway. The curiosity continued, and snowballed. Playing the paraplegic soldier of The Men (1950), Brando had gone to live at a Veterans Administration hospital with actual disabled veterans, and confined himself to a wheelchair for weeks. It was an acting method, research, that no one in Hollywood had ever heard of before, and that willingness to experience life.'),(657,'Michiel Huisman','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NDhiNTItOGNkNS00ODlhLWI3ZmMtZWFiMzBlYjk5NTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjAwMDkyMDI@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1981-07-18','Huisman was born on July 18, 1981 in Amstelveen, Noord-Holland, which is near Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Her mother moved to the U.S. in 1951, from Greenock, Scotland. Her father, from Burlington, New Jersey, has German, Irish, Welsh, German-Jewish, and English ancestry.Moore spent the early years of her life in over two dozen locations around the world with her parents, during her father\'s military career. She finally found her place at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in acting from the School of the Performing Arts. After graduation (in 1983), She took the stage name \"Julianne Moore\" because there was another actress named \"Julie Anne Smith\". Julianne moved to New York and worked extensively in theater, including appearances off-Broadway in two Caryl Churchill plays, Serious Money and Ice Cream With Hot Fudge and as Ophelia in Hamlet at The Guthrie Theatre. But despite her formal training, Julianne fell into the attractive actress\' trap of the mid-1980\'s: TV soaps and miniseries. She appeared briefly in the daytime serial The Edge of Night (1956) and from 1985 to 1988 she played two half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina on the soap As the World Turns (1956). This performance later led to an Outstanding Ingénue Daytime Emmy Award in 1988. Her subsequent appearances were in mostly forgettable TV-movies, such as Money, Power, Murder. (1989), The Last to Go (1991) and Cast a Deadly Spell (1991).She made her entrance into the big screen with 1990\'s Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990), where she played the victim of a mummy. Two years later, Julianne appeared in feature films with supporting parts in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992) and the comedy The Gun in Betty Lou\'s Handbag (1992). She kept winning better and more powerful roles as time went on, including a small but memorable role as a doctor who spots Kimble Harrison Ford and attempts to thwart his escape in Втiкач (1993). (A role that made such an impression on Steven Spielberg that he cast her in the Парк Юрського перiоду (1993) sequel without an audition in 1997). In one of Moore\'s most distinguished performances, she recapitulated her \"beguiling Yelena\" from Andre Gregory\'s workshop version of Chekhov\'s Uncle Vanya in Louis Malle\'s critically acclaimed Vanya on 42nd Street (1994). Director Todd Haynes gave Julianne her first opportunity to take on a lead role in Safe (1995). Her portrayal of Carol White, an affluent L.A. housewife who develops an inexplicable allergic reaction to her environment, won critical praise as well as an Independent Spirit Award nomination.Later that year she found her way into romantic comedy, co-starring as Hugh Grant\'s pregnant girlfriend in Nine Months (1995). Following films included Найманi вбивцi (1995), where she played an electronics security expert targeted for death (next to Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas) and Surviving Picasso (1996), where she played Dora Maar, one of the numerous lovers of Picasso (portrayed by her hero, Anthony Hopkins). A year later, after co-starring in Spielberg\'s Парк юрського перiоду II (1997), opposite Jeff Goldblum, a young and unknown director, Paul Thomas Anderson asked Julianne to appear in his movie, Ночi в стилi бугi (1997). Despite her misgivings, she finally was won over by the script and her decision to play the role of Amber Waves, a loving porn star who acts as a mother figure to a ragtag crew, proved to be a wise one, since she received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Julianne started 1998 by playing an erotic artist in Великий Лебовськi (1998), continued with a small role in the social comedy Chicago Cab (1997) and ended with a subtle performance in Gus Van Sant\'s remake of Психо (1960). 1999 had Moore as busy as an actress can be.As the century closed, Julianne starred in a number of high-profile projects, beginning with Robert Altman\'s Cookie\'s Fortune (1999) , in which she was cast as the mentally challenged but adorable sister of a decidedly unhinged Glenn Close. A portrayal of the scheming Mrs. Cheveley followed in Oliver Parker\'s An Ideal Husband (1999) with a number of critics asserting that Moore was the best part of the movie. She then enjoyed another collaboration with director Anderson in Магнолiя (1999) and continued with an outstanding performance in The End of the Affair (1999), for which she garnered another Oscar nomination.

Very much in demand these days as a character player, Patricia Clarkson nevertheless continues to avoid the temptation of money-making mainstream filming while reaping kudos and acting awards in out-of-the-way projects.The New Orleans born-and-bred performer with the given name of Patricia Davies Clarkson was born on December 29, 1959, the daughter of Arthur (\"Buzz\") Clarkson, a school administrator, and Jackie Clarkson, a local city politician and councilwoman. Patricia demonstrated an early interest in acting and managed to appear in a few junior high and high school-level plays while growing up. She took her basic college studies at Louisiana State University, studying speech for two years, before transferring to New York\'s Fordham University and graduating with honors in theatre arts.Accepted into the prestigious Yale School of Drama graduate program, she earned her Master of Fine Arts after gracing a wide range of productions including \"Electra,\" \"Pericles,\" \"Twelfth Night\", \"The Lower Depths,\" \"The Misanthrope,\" \"Pacific Overtures\" and \"La Ronde\". From there she took on New York City where she attracted strong East Coast notice in 1986 for her portrayal of Corrina in \"The House of Blue Leaves\" and in such other plays as \"Eastern Standard\" (1988) and \"Wolf-Man\" (1989).Known for her organic approach to acting, the flaxen-maned actress decided to try out her trademark whiskey voice in Hollywood at age 28, making her movie debut as Mrs. Eliot Ness in Brian De Palma\'s Недоторканнi (1987) starring Kevin Costner. The following years she gained attention for playing Samantha Walker in The Dead Pool (1988) where she starred opposite Clint Eastwood\'s popular \"Dirty Harry\" character. Playing supportive, wifely types at the onset, she became a strong contender for character stardom by the mid-to-late 1990s, not only on stage but in the independent film arena.On stage Patricia received impressive notices for her contributions to the plays \"Raised in Captivity,\" \"The Ride Down Mt. Morgan,\" \"Three Days of Rain\" and, in particular, \"The Maiden\'s Prayer,\" which nabbed her both Outer Critics Circle and Drama Desk Award nominations. In 2004, she finally enacted the classic part she seemed born to play, that of Southern belle Blanche DuBois in the Kennedy Center production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". She earned glowing notices. On camera she was offered roles of marked diversity. From the heavier dramatics of a film like Pharaoh\'s Army (1995), she could move deftly into light comedy, courtesy of Neil Simon in the TV-movie London Suite (1996). It was, however, her bleak, convulsive portrayal of Greta, a strung-out, heroin-happy German has-been actress, opposite a resurgent Ally Sheedy in the acclaimed art film High Art (1998) that truly put Patricia on the indie map. From this she was handed a silver plate\'s worth of excitingly offbeat roles. In 2003 alone, Patricia received a special acting prize at the Sundance Film Festival for her superb work in three films: as a somber, grieving artist in Начальник станцii (2003), a cold-hearted cancer victim in Pieces of April (2003), and a jokey, get-with-it mom in All the Real Girls (2003). She was nominated for a \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar for the second film mentioned.On TV Patricia received two Emmys for her recurring guest part as Frances Conroy\'s free-spirited sister in the acclaimed black comedy series Six Feet Under (2001). She also received the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics awards for her supporting work in the gorgeous, 1950s-styled melodrama Далеко вiд раю (2002), as a prim and proper Stepford-wife and deceptive friend to Julianne Moore.No matter the size, such as her extended cameos in Зелена миля (1999), All the Real Girls (2003), Miracle (2004) and Elegy (2008), Patricia manages to make the most of whatever screen time she has, often stealing scenes effortlessly.

His father is of Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent, and his mother was of Irish Catholic descent (she converted to Judaism).His parents made no real effort to keep their son away from the Hollywood lifestyle and he grew up among the stars, wondering just why his parents were so popular. At a young age, he and his sister Amy Stiller would perform plays at home, wearing Amy\'s tights to perform Shakespeare. Ben also picked up an interest in being on the other side of the camera and, at age 10, began shooting films on his Super 8 camera. The plots were always simple: someone would pick on the shy, awkward Stiller ... and then he would always get his revenge. This desire for revenge on the popular, good-looking people may have motivated his teen-angst opus Reality Bites (1994) later in his career. He both directed and performed in the film, which co-starred Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke.Before he got to Hollywood, he put in several consistently solid years in the theater. After dropping out of UCLA, he performed in the Tony Award winner, \"The House of Blue Leaves\". While working on the play, Stiller shot a short spoof of Колiр грошей (1986) starring him (in the Tom Cruise role) and his American Playhouse: The House of Blue Leaves (1987) costar John Mahoney (in the Paul Newman role). The short film was so funny that Lorne Michaels purchased it and aired it on Saturday Night Live (1975). This led to his spending a year on the show in 1989.Stiller made his big screen debut in Steven Spielberg\'s Iмперiя сонця (1987) in 1987. Demonstrating early on the multifaceted tone his career would take, he soon stepped behind the camera to direct Back to Brooklyn for MTV. The network was impressed and gave Stiller his own show, The Ben Stiller Show (1992). He recruited fellow offbeat comedians Janeane Garofalo and Andy Dick and created a bitingly satirical show. MTV ended up passing on it, but it was picked up by Fox. Unfortunately, the show was a ratings miss. Stiller was soon out of work, although he did have the satisfaction of picking up an Emmy for the show after its cancellation.For a while, Stiller had to settle for guest appearance work. While doing this, he saved up his cash and in the end was able to scrape enough together to make Reality Bites (1994), now a cult classic which is looked upon favorably by the generation it depicted. Ben continued to work steadily for a time, particularly in independent productions where he was more at ease. However, he never quite managed to catch a big break. His first big budget directing job was Jim Carrey\'s Кабельник (1996). Although many critics were impressed, Jim Carrey\'s fans were not. In 1998, Всi шаленiють вiд Мерi (1998) had propelled Stiller into the mainstream spotlight. He also starred in such hit movies as Keeping the Faith (2000) and Знайомство з батьками (2000).'),(668,'Anna Friel','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1Mjk3NTcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDcxMjE2Mg@@._V1_UY317_CR8,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1976-07-12','Anna Friel is an English actress, born in Rochdale.

His father was of Russian Jewish descent, and his maternal grandparents were Austrian Jewish immigrants. As a young boy, he became intrigued with magic tricks and playing the clarinet, two hobbies that he continues today.Allen broke into show business at 15 years when he started writing jokes for a local paper, receiving $200 a week. He later moved on to write jokes for talk shows but felt that his jokes were being wasted. His agents, Charles Joffe and Jack Rollins, convinced him to start doing stand-up and telling his own jokes. Reluctantly he agreed and, although he initially performed with such fear of the audience that he would cover his ears when they applauded his jokes, he eventually became very successful at stand-up. After performing on stage for a few years, he was approached to write a script for Warren Beatty to star in: What\'s New Pussycat (1965) and would also have a moderate role as a character in the film. During production, Woody gave himself more and better lines and left Beatty with less compelling dialogue. Beatty inevitably quit the project and was replaced by Peter Sellers, who demanded all the best lines and more screen-time.It was from this experience that Woody realized that he could not work on a film without complete control over its production. Woody\'s theoretical directorial debut was in What\'s Up, Tiger Lily? (1966); a Japanese spy flick that he dubbed over with his own comedic dialogue about spies searching for the secret recipe for egg salad. His real directorial debut came the next year in the mockumentary Take the Money and Run (1969). He has written, directed and, more often than not, starred in about a film a year ever since, while simultaneously writing more than a dozen plays and several books of comedy.While best known for his romantic comedies Еннi Голл (1977) and Мангеттен (1979), Woody has made many transitions in his films throughout the years, transitioning from his \"early, funny ones\" of Bananas (1971), Кохання i смерть (1975) and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask (1972); to his more storied and romantic comedies of Еннi Голл (1977), Мангеттен (1979) and Ганна та ii сестри (1986); to the Bergmanesque films of Stardust Memories (1980) and Interiors (1978); and then on to the more recent, but varied works of Злочини та порушення (1989), Husbands and Wives (1992), Mighty Aphrodite (1995), Знаменитiсть (1998) and Deconstructing Harry (1997); and finally to his films of the last decade, which vary from the light comedy of Сенсацiя (2006), to the self-destructive darkness of Матч-пойнт (2005) and, most recently, to the cinematically beautiful tale of Вiкi, Крiстiна, Барселона (2008).

In the Big Apple, she instantly snagged lucrative assignments as a photographer\'s model for the likes of Peter Lindbergh, then discovered an inborn passion for acting and decided to make it the focus of her life.Born into a family of performers - her grandfather Richard Davalos starred alongside James Dean in На схiд вiд раю (1955) - in 2002, Davalos turned her focus to acting and migrated to Los Angeles and began signing for guest parts on series such as Angel (1999) and Undeclared (2001).

When the highly-touted series failed to catch on with viewers and was canceled after half a season, Davalos bounced back with a convincing portrayal as Diane Keaton\'s daughter in the well-received made-for-television feature Surrender, Dorothy (2006). The following year, Davalos stepped up several notches with a lead role in Robert Benton\'s much-anticipated drama Свято кохання (2007) -- an ensemble piece about a free-spirited woman who arrives in a small Northwestern town and recolors the life of everyone she meets.

Her strict father was a factory worker, and her mother was a homemaker. She was the second of four children. At the age of 15, she studied in Saegertown High School, Pennsylvania, and at that same age, entered Edinboro State University of Pennsylvania, and graduated with a degree in creative writing and fine arts. She was a very smart girl (with an IQ of 154), became a bookworm, and once was told that a suitable job for her (and her brains) was to become a lawyer. However, her first love was still the black-and-white movies, especially those featuring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. So, the 17-year-old Sharon got herself into the Miss Crawford County and won the beauty contest.From working part-time as a McDonald\'s counter girl, she worked her way up to become a successful Ford model, both in TV commercials and print ads. In 1980, she made her acting debut in Woody Allen\'s Stardust Memories (1980) as \"pretty girl in train\". Her first speaking part, though, was in Wes Craven\'s horror movie, Deadly Blessing (1981). She struggled through many parts in B-movies, notably King Solomon\'s Mines (1985) and Action Jackson (1988). She was also married in 1984 to Michael Greenburg, the producer of MacGyver (1985), but they divorced two years later.She finally got her big break with Arnold Schwarzenegger in Згадати все (1990) and also posed nude for Playboy, a daring move for a 32-year-old actress. But it worked; she landed the breakthrough role as a sociopath novelist, \"Catherine Tramell\", in Основний iнстинкт (1992). Her interrogation scene has become a classic in film history and her performance captivated everyone, from MTV viewers, who honored her with Most Desirable Female and Best Female Performance Awards, to a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. After she got famous, she didn\'t want to be typecast, so she played a victim in Sliver (1993), and, in Intersection (1994), she was the aloof, estranged wife of Richard Gere. These movies didn\'t \"work,\" so she got herself again into more aggressive roles , such as Спецiалiст (1994) with Sylvester Stallone and The Quick and the Dead (1995) with Gene Hackman.But it wasn\'t until she played a beautiful but drug-crazy wife of Robert De Niro in Казино (1995) that she got far more than just fame and fortune--she also received the acknowledgment of the movie industry for her acting ability. She received her first Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. She did a couple of films afterwards, teaming up with Isabelle Adjani in Diabolique (1996), and as a woman waiting for her death penalty in Last Dance (1996). In 1998, she married a newspaper editor,Phil Bronstein but they divorced later in 2004.

Brandy had filed for divorce in 1959 after having three children with Lucius, but the exes had a brief re-encounter in 1962 which resulted in Alicia\'s birth. Her older siblings nicknamed her \"Jodie\", a name she has used in her profession. She started her career at the age of two and made commercials for four years before making her debut as an actress in the TV series Mayberry R.F.D. (1968), on which her brother, Buddy Foster, was a regular. She stayed very busy as a child actress, working on television programs such as The Doris Day Show (1968), Adam-12 (1968), The Courtship of Eddie\'s Father (1969), The Partridge Family (1970), Bonanza (1959), and Gunsmoke (1955). In movies, her roles included playing Raquel Welch\'s daughter in Kansas City Bomber (1972) and a tomboyish delinquent in Alice Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore (1974).Jodie first drew attention from critics with her appearance in Martin Scorsese\'s Таксист (1976) alongside Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, where she played a prostitute at the tender age of 12 (she was 13 when the movie premiered) and received her first Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress. She went on to have a very successful career in her early teens with leading roles in the Disney films Freaky Friday (1976) with Barbara Harris and Candleshoe (1977) opposite veteran film legends David Niven and Helen Hayes. The last film she made during this era was the coming-of-age drama Foxes (1980), before enrolling at Yale University. During her freshman year at Yale, she was attached to a worldwide scandal when a crazed and obsessed fan named John Hinckley shot President Ronald Reagan to impress her.Jodie graduated from Yale in 1985 with a degree in literature. She resumed her acting career and sought a breakthrough role that would return her to stardom. After appearing in a few obscure movies with limited release, Jodie landed an audition for The Accused (1988) and was cast in the part of Sarah Tobias, a waitress who is gang-raped in a bar during a night of partying and teams up with a lawyer played by Kelly McGillis to prosecute the attackers. This performance earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, but despite the Oscar win, Jodie still hadn\'t re-established herself as a bankable star. Her next film, Catchfire (1990), went straight to video, and she had to campaign hard to get her next good role. In 1991, she starred as Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee assisting in a hunt for a serial killer in Мовчання ягнят (1991) with Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, and Brooke Smith. The film was a blockbuster hit, winning Jodie her second Academy Award for Best Actress and establishing her as an international movie star. With the wealth and fame to do anything she wanted, Jodie started directing. She made her directorial debut with Little Man Tate (1991), which was followed by Home for the Holidays (1995). These films were critically acclaimed but did not do well at the box office, and she proved to be a far more successful actress than she was a director.1994 was a huge triumph for her acting career. She first played a sexy con artist in the successful western comedy Меверiк (1994) with Mel Gibson and James Garner. Then, she played title role in Nell (1994), co-starring Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson. For her compelling performance as a wild, backwoods hermit who speaks an invented language and must return to civilization, Jodie was nominated for another Academy Award and won a Screen Actors Guild Award as Best Actress.Although she was working far less frequently as an adult than she did as a child, the films she turned out were commercially successful and critically acclaimed. Her next big screen role was in the science fiction drama Контакт (1997) opposite Matthew McConaughey. She played a scientist who receives signals from space aliens. The film was a huge hit and brought her a Golden Globe nomination. She starred in the non-musical remake of The King and I (1956) entitled Anna and the King (1999), which was only modestly received in the U.S. but was very successful overseas. Three years after that she headlined the thriller Кiмната страху (2002), which co-starred Kristen Stewart, Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto. The film was a smash box-office hit and gave Jodie a $30 million opening weekend, the biggest of her career yet. She then appeared in two low-profile projects: the independent film The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (2002) and the foreign film Довгi заручини (2004). She returned to making Hollywood mainstream films, first with Iлюзiя польоту (2005), in which she played a woman whose daughter disappears on an airplane that she designed. Once again Jodie proved herself to be a box-office draw, and the film was a worldwide hit.The following year, she starred in another hit, the bank heist thriller Не впiймали - не злодiй (2006) with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Jodie was on a roll. Her next film was the revenge thriller The Brave One (2007), which once again opened at #1 at the box office and earned her another Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.

He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 причин моeii ненавистi (1999), Патрiот (2000), Iсторiя лицаря (2001), Бал монстрiв (2001), Ned Kelly (2003), The Brothers Grimm (2005), Lords of Dogtown (2005), Горбата гора (2005), Казанова (2005), Candy (2006), Мене там немаe. (2007), Темний лицар (2008) and Iмаджинарiум доктора Парнаса (2009). He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. His ancestry was Scottish, English, Irish, and Sephardi Jewish. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive cliché; an adolescent angst film about one boy\'s struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in Home and Away (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in Paws (1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri\'s brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \"Oberon\". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Roar (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga.Then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 причин моeii ненавистi (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama Патрiот (2000).What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Бал монстрiв (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Горбата гора (2005). For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in in the film, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. His death occurred during editing of Темний лицар (2008) and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in Iмаджинарiум доктора Парнаса (2009).Posthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film Мене там немаe. (2007), which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan\'s life and persona.A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in \'Темний лицар (2008). His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received more than thirty posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance as the Joker, the psychopathic clown prince of crime, in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he is the second actor to win an acting award posthumously after Peter Finch who won an Oscar for Network (Best Actor 1977)), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.'),(694,'Paul Bettany','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUzMDIzNjkxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjgyNzA0MjI@._V1_UY317_CR131,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1971-05-27','Paul Bettany is an English actor.

Dern was exposed to movie sets and the movie industry from infancy, and obtained several bit parts as a child. Her parents divorced when Dern was two and Dern lost contact with her father for several years as a result.Her parents\' background and her own early taste of the moviemaking world soon convinced the young Dern to pursue acting herself. Like so many young actors, her decision may have been influenced by social awkwardness -- the child of 60s counterculture parents, she was steeped in Eastern mysticism and political radicalism, and was seen as an oddball by her more conservative classmates. Her gawky physical appearance didn\'t help - even before her teens, she had achieved most of her impressive 5\' 10\" height, was rail-skinny (other than precociously wide hips), had huge feet and a slouching posture, and for all this was often teased by classmates. Perhaps the nine-year-old Dern found refuge by studying acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute.The first success for the young Dern came in 1980, with a role in Adrian Lyne\'s Foxes (1980), a teen movie starring Jodie Foster. She followed this with several small parts, or parts in small movies, such as Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and Teachers (1984), as a student who has an affair with a teacher. (Her mother objected to her active presence on movie sets at age thirteen, which required Dern to sue for emancipation so she could play her role in \"The Fabulous Stains\"). Her next roles, as the blind girl who befriends the deformed boy in Маска (1985), and as a teenaged girl whose sexual awakening collides with a mysterious older man in Smooth Talk (1985), gave her career an important boost. Dern appeared to have made it with a leading role in David Lynch\'s acclaimed Синiй оксамит (1986), but it was four years before her next notable film, and this was the bizarre Wild at Heart (1990), also directed by Lynch.The following year, Dern starred in Rambling Rose (1991), which would become her signature performance, as a sexually-precocious, free-spirited young housemaid in the South in the 1930s. Dern earned an Oscar nomination for her performance, and so did her mother and co-star, Diane Ladd. Dern continues to win prominent roles on the big screen, often in smaller, highly-regarded human dramas such as Жовтневе небо (1999), Я - Сем (2001) and We Don\'t Live Here Anymore (2004), although she is perhaps most widely known for her repeat role as Ellie Sattler in the summer adventure movies Парк Юрського перiоду (1993) and Парк юрського перiоду III (2001), or for her guest performance on Ellen (1994), as the woman to whom Ellen finally comes out as a lesbian.Dern\'s pre-teen gawkiness matured into lithe beauty, but this doesn\'t prevent Dern from fearlessly throwing herself into a wide variety of roles which are sometimes unflattering, an excellent example being her unflinchingly comic portrayal of an intensely annoying loser whose pregnancy becomes a social and political football in Citizen Ruth (1996). This results in Dern being one of the most interesting actors working in Hollywood today.Having previously dated such Hollywood talent as Treat Williams, Renny Harlin, Kyle MacLachlan, Jeff Goldblum and Billy Bob Thornton, Dern eventually married musician Ben Harper in 2005. Early in her career, Dern was roommate to Marianne Williamson, the spirituality guru. Dern attended two days of college at UCLA and one semester at USC.'),(702,'Elena Anaya','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3NjkwMjk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyMTM0MjI@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1975-07-17','Spanish actress Elena Anaya impressed the critics with her performance in Люсiя i секс (2001).Elena was born in Palencia, Spain, on July 17th, 1975.

He grew up in Vancouver. During his childhood, he aspired to become an actor, which eventually was the real reason behind his move to New York. There, Taylor pursued his dreams by studying the art of acting with coach Sheila Grey. Not too long after that, Taylor was cast in several film and television roles, such as Здохни, Джон Такер (2006), Snakes on a Plane (2006) and Kyle XY (2006).Moving to New York in 2002 was the prize that Taylor received after being scouted by modeling scouts in Canada. Taylor was signed to \"IMG Models\" and became a regular face for the famous clothing lines, \"Abercrombie & Fitch\" and also \"Diesel\". Taylor was also signed under \"Untitled Entertainment\" during his two years stay in the city. While Taylor was living in New York, he found time to become a certified personal trainer and nutritionist. In the year 2004, Taylor decided that it was time for him to move to Los Angeles to learn more about the acting course. Taylor stayed in Los Angeles for about eight months and did some print work with \"Nous Modeling Management\". It wasn\'t too long until Taylor realized that he didn\'t want to be in Los Angeles. Taylor thought that things were running a little bit too fast for him, then making the decision to move back to Vancouver for the summer of 2005 to spend more time with his family. In 2006, Taylor then signed with \"Endeavour\".What shot him to bigger fame was his role in the movie, The Covenant (2006), with actors Steven Strait, Toby Hemingway and Chace Crawford. In the stylish thriller from Lakeshore Entertainment and Sony Screen Gems, four young witches do battle with a powerful, centuries-old supernatural force. In \"The Covenant\", fans got to know who Taylor really is. Even though the movie wasn\'t as successful as people hoped it would be, Taylor became more recognized since acting in the movie. In the movie, fans also got to see a more fit and toned version of Taylor.Fortunately, after \"The Covenant\", casting directors from the football teen drama, Friday Night Lights (2006), saw the talent that Taylor had. They eventually hired Taylor to play the role of \"Tim Riggins\", one of the Dillon Panthers\' main players. On \"Friday Night Lights\", Taylor managed to show his acting skills to fans and television critics who were very impressed with Taylor\'s acting skills. USA Today called the series \"one of the best-acted, best-written, best-produced shows on television\". After receiving fame and gaining a big fan base from \"Friday Night Lights\", Taylor received the acting publicity he had always been waiting for.During the show\'s summer hiatus, Taylor filmed the feature Gospel Hill (2008), alongside Julia Stiles, Danny Glover, Angela Bassett and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Giancarlo Esposito, the film focuses on the bigoted former sheriff of a southern town and a one-time civil rights worker whose intersecting lives are still haunted by events that took place decades earlier. Old wounds are reopened as residents of a black neighborhood are forced out of their homes to make way for a multi-million dollar development.In February 2008, he signed on to play \"Gambit\" in the \"X-Men\" franchise spin-off, Люди Iкс: Початок.

His film presence has been filled with memorable roles that range from an inwardly tortured hit man, to an adventurous explorer, a determined-but-failing writer, and the greatest military leader in history.Farrell was born on May 31, 1976 in Castleknock, Dublin, Ireland, to Rita (Monaghan) and Eamon Farrell. His father and uncle were both professional athletes, and for a while, it looked like Farrell would follow in their footsteps. Farrell auditioned for a part in the Irish Boy Band, Boyzone, but it didn\'t work out. After dropping out of the Gaiety School of Acting, Farrell was cast in Ballykissangel (1996), a BBC television drama. \"Ballykissangel\" was not his first role on screen. Farrell had previously been in The War Zone (1999), directed by Tim Roth and had appeared in the independent film Drinking Crude (1997). Farrell was soon to move on to bigger things.Exchanging his usually thick Dublin accent for a light Texas drawl, Farrell acted in the gritty Tigerland (2000), directed by Joel Schumacher. Starring Farrell amongst a number of other budding young actors, the film portrays a group of new recruits being trained for the war in Vietnam. Farrell played the arrogant soldier Boz, drafted into the army and completely spiteful of authority. The film was praised by critics, but did not make much money at the box office. It was Farrell\'s first big role on film, and certainly not his last. Farrell followed up with American Outlaws (2001), where he played the notorious outlaw Jesse James with Scott Caan, son of legendary actor James Caan, in the role of Cole Younger. The film was a box office flop and failure with the critics. Immediately, Farrell returned to the war drama film that had made him famous. Co-starring in the war film Вiйна Харта (2002) opposite Bruce Willis, Farrell played the young officer captured by the enemy. The film was another failure. Farrell struck gold when he was cast in the Steven Spielberg film Особлива думка (2002) that same year. Set in a futuristic time period, Farrell played the character Danny Witwer, a young member of the Justice Department who is sent after Tom Cruise\'s character. The film was a smash hit, and praised by critics.Farrell continued this success when he reunited with Joel Schumacher on the successful thriller Телефонна будка (2002). Farrell played the role of the victim who is harassed by an unseen killer (Kiefer Sutherland) and is made to reveal his sins to the public. 2003 was a big year for Farrell. He starred in the crime thriller Рекрут (2003) as a young CIA man mentored by an older CIA veteran (Al Pacino). Pacino later stated that Farrell was the best actor of his generation. Farrell certainly continued to be busy that year with Шибайголова (2003), which actually allowed him to keep his thick Irish accent. The film was another success for Farrell, as was the crime film Спецназ мiста янголiв (2003) where Farrell starred opposite Samuel L. Jackson and LL Cool J. Farrell also acted in the Irish black comedy film Intermission (2003) and appeared another Irish film Veronica Guerin (2003) which reunited him with Joel Schumacher once again. The following year, Farrell acted in what is his most infamous film role yet: the title role in the mighty Oliver Stone film epic Alexander (2004), which is a character study of Alexander the Great as he travels across new worlds and conquers all the known world before him. Farrell donned a blond wig and retained his Irish accent, and gave a fine performance as Alexander. However, both he and the film were criticized. Despite being one of the highest grossing films internationally and doing a good job at the DVD sales, Farrell did not come out of the experience without a few hurts. Farrell attempted to rebound with his historical film The New World (2005). Reuniting with \"Alexander\" star Christopher Plummer, and also acting with Christian Bale, Farrell played the brave explorer John Smith, who would make first contacts with the Native peoples. The film did not do well at the box office, though critics praised the film\'s stunning appearance and cinematography.Farrell returned to act in Michael Mann\'s film Miami Vice (2006) alongside Jamie Foxx. The film was a film adaptation of the famous television series, and did reasonably well at the box office. Farrell also acted in Ask the Dust (2006) with Salma Hayek and Donald Sutherland, though the film did not receive much distribution. The next year, Farrell acted alongside Ewan McGregor in the Woody Allen film Мрiя Кассандри (2007) which received mixed reviews from critics. Farrell followed up with the hilarious black comedy Залягти на дно в Брюге (2008). Written and directed by Irish theatre director Martin McDonagh, the film stars Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two Irish hit men whose latest assignment went wrong, leaving them to hide out in Bruges, Belgium. The film has been one of Farrell\'s most praised work, and he was nominated for a Golden Globe. As well as Залягти на дно в Брюге (2008), Farrell acted alongside Edward Norton in the crime film Pride and Glory (2008) which was not as successful as the former film. As well as working with charity, and speaking at the Special Olympics World Games in 2007, he has donated his salary for Terry Gilliam\'s Iмаджинарiум доктора Парнаса (2009) to Heath Ledger\'s little daughter (who was left nothing in a will that had not been updated in time). Ledger had originally been cast in the film and was replaced by Farrell, Johnny Depp and Jude Law. The film was a critical and financial success, and Farrell also played a small role in Шалене серце (2009) which had the Dubliner playing a country singer. Farrell even sang a few songs for the film\'s soundtrack. As well as those small roles, Farrell took the lead role in the war film Triage (2009). Farrell incredibly lost forty-four pounds to play the role of a war photographer who must come to terms with what he has experienced in Kurdistan. While the film was finely made, with excellent performances from all involved, the film has received almost no distribution.Farrell\'s other leading role that year was in Neil Jordan\'s Irish film Ундина (2009). In recent years, he co-starred in the comedy horror film Нiчка жахiв (2011), the science fiction action film Згадати все (2012), both remakes, and McDonagh\'s second feature, and the black comedy crime film 7 психопатiв (2012). Since the mid-2000s, Farrell has cleaned up his act, and far from being a Hollywood hell raiser and party animal, Farrell has shown himself to be a respectable and very talented actor.He also starred in The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), both directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. For The Lobster he was nominated for an Golden Globe.'),(713,'Sherilyn Fenn','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MDYwNTEyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM3NDk1._V1_UY317_CR10,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1965-02-01','The sultry, versatile, petite (5\' 4\") beauty Sherilyn Fenn was born Sheryl Ann Fenn in Detroit, Michigan, into a family of musicians. The youngest of three children, her mother, Arlene Quatro, played keyboard in rock bands, her aunt is rock-star Suzi Quatro, and her grandfather, Art Quatro, was a jazz musician. Her father, Leo Fenn, was the manager of such bands as The Pleasure Seekers (the all-girl band formed by the Quatro sisters), Alice Cooper, and The Billion Dollar Babies. Sherilyn\'s ancestry includes Irish, Italian, Hungarian, German, and Bohemian Czech.Sherilyn traveled a lot with her divorced mother and two older brothers before the family settled in Los Angeles when she was seventeen. Fenn, who says herself she\'s demure didn\'t want to start with a new school again and soon enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.Fenn began her career with a number of B-movies including The Wild Life (1984) (alongside Chris Penn), skater film Thrashin\' (1986) (opposite Josh Brolin) and teen-fantasy movie The Wraith (1986) (opposite Charlie Sheen). She had a memorable part in the cult teen-comedy Just One of the Guys (1985) in which she tries to seduce a teenage girl disguised as a boy, played by Joyce Hyser. Fenn landed her first starring role, as an engaged heiress to an old Southern family experiencing her sexual awakening in Zalman King\'s erotic drama film Two Moon Junction (1988), after which she said she wanted to hide for a year. Fenn won her most outstanding role and made an indelible impression on the public when she was cast by David Lynch and Mark Frost as the tantalizing Audrey Horne, the high-school femme fatale from the critically acclaimed TV series Твiн Пiкс (1990). The series ran from 1990 to 1991, and the character of Audrey was one of the most popular with fans, in particular for her unrequited love for FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan) and her style from the \'50s (with her saddle shoes, plaid skirts and tight sweaters). Sherilyn made a memorable impression as the cherry stem-twisting siren. This was her breakout role; even now she says of her Твiн Пiкс (1990) experience: \"It still makes me feel kind of proud and special to be part of something like that\". In the show\'s second season, when the idea of pairing Audrey and Cooper was abandoned, Audrey was paired with other characters like Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and John Justice Wheeler (Billy Zane). Sherilyn hit cult status when Lynch filmed her dancing on Angelo Badalamenti\'s music and with another memorable scene in which her character knotted a cherry stem with her tongue.Shortly after shooting Twin Peaks\' pilot episode, David Lynch gave her a small but impressive part in Wild at Heart (1990), as a girl injured in a car wreck, obsessed by the contents of her purse, opposite Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. According to Fenn, the turning point in her career was when she met veteran acting coach Roy London in 1990. She credits him with instilling confidence and newfound enthusiasm.After two nominations (Emmy and Golden Globe) and covers for Rolling Stone and Playboy magazines, Fenn was propelled to stardom and became a major sex symbol. She was chosen as one of People magazine\'s \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\", was named one of the \"10 Most Beautiful Women in the World\" by Us magazine, and one of the \"100 Sexiest Women in the World\" by FHM magazine. Fenn\'s classic looks - with her lily-white skin, vertiginous boomerang eyebrows, beauty mark next to her left eye and topaz eyes - were highlighted by renowned photographers like George Hurrell Sr., Steven Meisel, and Bettina Rheims, and led her to be compared to the ones like Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner. Fenn has had an eclectic career with a significant body of work following Твiн Пiкс (1990). She chose to focus on widening her range of roles and was determined to avoid typecasting. She turned down the Audrey Horne spin-off series that was offered to her, and unlike most of the cast, chose not to return for the 1992 prequel movie Твiн Пiкс: Вогню, iди зi мною (1992), as she was then shooting Про мишей та людей (1992). She proved her mettle as an actress with varied roles in neo-noir black comedy Desire and Hell at Sunset Motel (1991) (as a sultry femme fatale, opposite Whip Hubley and David Hewlett), huis-clos Diary of a Hitman (1991) (the directorial debut of her acting coach Roy London, in which she plays a fragile mother who confronts hitman Forest Whitaker), John Mackenzie\'s fictionalized biopic Ruby (1992), (as stripper Sheryl Ann DuJean, a Marilyn Monroe look-alike fictional character, who is a composite of several real-life women from Jack Ruby and president John Kennedy\'s entourage; opposite \'Danny Aiello\' and Arliss Howard), romantic comedy Three of Hearts (1993) (as Kelly Lynch and William Baldwin\'s love interest), Carl Reiner\'s 1940s detective parody Fatal Instinct (1993) (as Armand Assante\'s lovesick secretary and Sean Young and Kate Nelligan\'s rival) and Showtime\'s biblical Slave of Dreams (1995), directed by Robert M. Young (as Potiphar\'s seductive wife Zulaikha, opposite Adrian Pasdar and Edward James Olmos, and produced by Dino De Laurentiis).A highlight of Fenn\'s film career is Gary Sinise\'s film adaptation of Про мишей та людей (1992), in which she brought nuance to the role of a seductive and lonely country wife, desperately in need to talk to somebody, opposite Sinise and John Malkovich. In 1993, Fenn teamed up with David Lynch\'s daughter Jennifer Lynch and starred in her directorial debut Boxing Helena (1993) as a haughty seductress forced to live in a box after her limbs were amputated by love-obsessed surgeon Julian Sands in an effort to possess her (a role Kim Basinger backed out of). Both Lynch and Fenn were proud of their work in it but the film - which was overshadowed by the lawsuits against Kim Basinger after she dropped out - ultimately was a critical and commercial failure. Another outstanding performance was in NBC\'s miniseries Liz: The Elizabeth Taylor Story (1995). During the shooting, Fenn fought to keep integrity in the script. Her priority was to respectfully and accurately portray Taylor, and she supported the original screenwriter\'s effort to concentrate on Taylor the person, not the legend. The same year she starred in an episode of Tales from the Crypt (1989) directed by Robert Zemeckis, alongside Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow, as the lover of Humphrey Bogart, who appeared in the episode via CGI special effects. She went on to star in independent films that have been well received on the festival circuit like Jon Harmon Feldman\'s Lovelife (1997) (as a low self-esteemed waitress, along with Bruce Davison, Jon Tenney, Carla Gugino and Saffron Burrows), romantic comedy Just Write (1997) (as the dream actress of Hollywood tour bus driver Jeremy Piven, who mistakes him for a famous screenwriter) and Adrian Pasdar\'s neo-noir directorial debut Cement (2000), a contemporary re-telling of \"Othello\", in which she played a tempting but imprudent femme fatale, alongside Chris Penn, Jeffrey Wright and Henry Czerny.Tired of Hollywood, Fenn contemplated starting a European career when she starred opposite Ray Winstone in the British psychological drama and huis-clos Darkness Falls (1999) (as a wealthy, neglected wife, sequestered with her husband by a man determined to understand the events that led to his wife ending up in a coma). She eventually decided to return to the United-States and gained newfound enthusiasm with the lead role in Showtime\'s dark comedy Rude Awakening (1998) as Billie Frank, an alcoholic ex-soap actress who struggles with her self-destructive habits. Based upon creator/executive producer Claudia Lonow\'s experience, the series ran from 1998 to 2001 and co-starred Lynn Redgrave, Jonathan Penner and Mario Van Peebles. Following Rude Awakening (1998), Fenn\'s film and television credits have included Showtime\'s family comedy Off Season (2001), directed by Bruce Davison (along with Hume Cronyn, Rory Culkin, Adam Arkin and Davison; as a singer who takes care of her orphaned nephew), Matthew Ryan Hoge\'s The United States of Leland (2003) (as a woman who represents happiness and joie de vivre to Ryan Gosling), Showtime\'s Cavedweller (2004) (2004, along with Kyra Sedgwick and directed by Lisa Cholodenko), Geretta Geretta\'s Whitepaddy (2006) (opposite Lisa Bonet and Hill Harper, as a woman who struggles with her dysfunctional family after she reluctantly returned home and tries to fit in with her new neighborhood that has become predominantly black), Emily Skopov\'s Novel Romance (2006) (as a pregnancy shop owner, opposite Traci Lords and Paul Johansson), psychological thriller Presumed Dead (2006) (as a female detective working on a missing person case, who has to outwit crime novelist Duncan Regehr in order to get to the truth), and The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning (2007) (as a flirtatious version of Lulu Hogg).Fenn has appeared along with Rob Estes and Milo Ventimiglia in a 2003 episode of Amy Sherman-Palladino\'s Дiвчата Гiлмор (2000), which was the pilot for a California-set spin-off, eventually dropped by the network. Sherman-Palladino brought her back in the series with a different part as Scott Patterson\'s ex-girlfriend and protective mother to his daughter (2006-2007). Fenn had previously had recurring parts on Затока Доусона (1998), (2002, as Joshua Jackson\'s seductive boss) and Boston Public (2000) (2003-2004, as a porn star turned tutor). Other notable guest appearances have included 21 Jump Street (1987) (opposite her then-fiancé Johnny Depp), Друзi (1994) (1997, as Matthew Perry\'s wooden-legged girlfriend), The Outer Limits (1995) (2001, as a duplicated scientist), Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) (2002, as a manipulative actress), and The 4400 (2004) (2005, as Jean DeLynn Baker, a 4400 who has the ability to grow deadly toxin-emitting spores on her hands).Fenn\'s interest in directing and children led her to step behind the camera to direct in 2006 a documentary film about the child enrichment program CosmiKids and Judy Julin, the program\'s founder. She subsequently joined its executive team as executive director of the film and television division.On set, Sherilyn is noted for having a quirky sense of humor and a joie de vivre. Off-screen, Sherilyn is proud of the friendship she has maintained with her ex-hubby Toulouse Holliday, a musician and film technician. Sherilyn lives with her son, Myles, and two cats: Ophelia and Redmond. Sherilyn practices meditative kundalini yoga, and every room in her house has feng shui elements-- crystals in one corner, water in another. Sherilyn enjoys biking, swimming and cooking, and of course being a mom: \"After I had my son, I found life much funnier and brighter\".'),(714,'Maggie Smith','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NzYxNjc5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTMzOTg1._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','One of the world\'s most famous and distinguished actresses, Dame Maggie Smith was born Margaret Natalie Smith in Essex.

In addition, Page appeared in the cult hit TV series Trailer Park Boys (2001).As the lead in David Slade\'s Тверда цукерка (2005), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, Page garnered much praise for her tour de force performance as a 14-year-old girl who meets a 30-year-old photographer on the Internet and then looks to expose him as pedophile.

Only recently has she been opening herself up more to doing television (the series Gemini Division (2008), which she executive-produced), and animated voice-overs. Dawson\'s powerhouse talent stands out the most in edgy, urban filming that dates back to 1995 when she was only sixteen.A rags-to-riches article entitled \"Rosario Dawson: From Tenement to Tinseltown\" probably says it all. Rosario was born on May 9, 1979 in New York City. Her mother, Isabel Celeste, of Puerto Rican and Afro-Cuban descent, is a singer, and her stepfather, who raised her, Greg Dawson, of Irish descent, is a construction laborer. Her parents, who married when both were teenagers, eventually divorced. Rosario and her younger brother, Clay Dawson, had it hard while growing up, and were cared for by family members, most of whom were poverty-stricken, and some of whom were HIV-positive.Her career actually started as a child when she made a minor showing on the children\'s show, Вулиця Сезам (1969). As the story goes, she was \"discovered\" as an adolescent on her front porch step by two photographers. One of them, Harmony Korine, was an aspiring screenwriter who thought the inexperienced sixteen-year-old was ideal for the controversial cult film Дiтки (1995), in which she would portray a sexually active adolescent. It took time for Rosario\'s film career to kick in after that, but by the late 1990s, she had nabbed several independent films. Since then, she has moved into main-stream hits (and misses) and has surprised viewers with her earthy, provocative, uninhibited approach to her roles.Reflecting New York\'s tougher, tawdrier side as assorted streetwalkers, homeless mothers, drug addicts, etc., her film highlights have included Light It Up (1999), Edward Burns\' Sidewalks of New York (2001), Spike Lee\'s 25-та година (2002) and Shattered Glass (2003). For Oliver Stone, she portrayed the duped bride of Colin Farrell\'s famed B.C. Macedonian warrior, Alexander (2004) (as in \"...the Great\"), which featured a notoriously violent-tinged nude/sex scene.Expanding her horizons beyond film, she has always expressed interest in singing. She hooked up with Prince for the re-release of his 1980s hit \"1999\" and appeared in The Chemical Brothers\' video for the song \"Out of Control\" from the album \"Surrender\". She is also featured on the Outkast track, \"She Lives in My Lap\". On stage, she co-starred as Julia in a revival of \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" at the Public Theater\'s \"Shakespeare in the Park\" and appeared in \"The Vagina Monologues\".She lucked into and got to show off her singing chops in the film adaptation of the hit New York musical Rent (2005), when Daphne Rubin-Vega, the original Mimi, became pregnant and was unable to reprise her exotic dancer role. Rosario also appeared as a prostitute in the adaptation of the graphic novel Мiсто грiхiв (2005). Of late, she has turned to producing. One of those, Descent (2007), had her playing a college coed who is brutally attacked and raped by a fellow student. Her more popular ventures have thus far included the role of Valerie Brown in the live-action version of the comic strip Josie and the Pussycats (2001), the Will Smith starrer Люди в Чорному 2 (2002), Орлиний зiр (2008) with Shia LaBeouf and Сiм душ (2008), again with Smith, in which she offered one of her more tender-hearted performances as a woman with a potentially fatal heart condition.Off-camera, the still-single Dawson is highly active in political, social and environmental causes and has been involved with such organizations/charities/campaigns as the Lower East Side Girls Club, Global Cool, the O.N.E. Campaign, Oxfam, Amnesty International, Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, Control Arms, International Rescue Committee, Voto Latino (which she founded), Conservation International, Doctors Without Borders, National Geographic Society, The Nature Conservancy and Save the Children. In October 2008, she lent her voice to the RESPECT!

During its lengthy run, she received three Golden Globe and two American Comedy Award nominations. As popular and identifiable as her Peg Bundy persona was, Katey assertively moved on without a hitch after the show went off the air, not only starring in other sitcoms and television movies, but portraying characters that were polar opposite to the outrageous role that first earned her nationwide attention. For example, In 2008, she took on the role of Gemma Teller Morrow -- the matriarch of a Hell\'s Angels-esque California biker gang -- on the series Sons of Anarchy (2008), and in 2011, her portrayal earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama.In addition to her busy on-camera scheduling, Katey has retraced her steps back to her first love: singing and songwriting. With the support of her record label Valley Entertainment, she released the album \"Room\" in 2004, which combined such classics as \"Feel a Whole Lot Better\" and \"(For the Love of) Money\" with original songs she penned, including \"Life Goes Round\", \"Daddy\'s Girl\" and \"Wish I Were a Kid\". \"Room\" is her first CD since her 1994 debut \"Well\".Born Catherine Louise Sagal, her father was the late Boris Sagal, the noted television and film director; her mother, Sara Zwilling, was a director and singer. Katey began performing at age 5 and studied voice and acting at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California. A singing waitress during her \"salad\" years, she first started performing with the band \"The Group with No Name\", and then caught a break after hooking up with Gene Simmons and his 1970s rock band KISS. In the meantime, she gained valuable experience as a backup recording singer for Simmons and such other established stars as Bob Dylan, Olivia Newton-John, Etta James and Tanya Tucker. Katey also was dynamic performing live backup with diva Bette Midler as one of her \"Harlettes\" in Bette\'s wildly avant garde stage shows during the late 1970s and early 1980s.In 1985, while performing on stage in a musical, she was spotted by talent agents who subsequently cast her as Mary Tyler Moore\'s feisty co-worker Jo Tucker in Mary (1985), a short-lived comedy series. From that point on she focused on film and television. In 1987, she won the role of Peg Bundy in Married with Children (1987), and the rest is history.In her post-Bundy career, Katey has continued to demonstrate a strong range, playing a much more responsible parent in the popular sitcom 8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter (2002). Co-starring the late John Ritter, Katey valiantly moved to single head of household after Ritter\'s sudden passing in 2003 with highly successful results. Katey has earned equally fine kudos for her television movies, appearing in such fare as Chance of a Lifetime (1998), a charming romantic comedy that also co-starred John Ritter, God\'s New Plan (1999), a tearjerker in which she played a dying mother, and the Disney offerings Smart House (1999) and The Wonderful World of Disney: Mr. Headmistress (1998). The voice of Turanga Leela, the beautiful one-eyed sewer mutant, in the animated series Футурама (1999), she also has guested on such series as Ghost Whisperer (2005), Загубленi (2004), Бостонське правосуддя (2004), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000) and Eli Stone (2008).

McGillis dropped out of high school to pursue a career as an actress, and attended Juilliard in Manhattan and Pacific Conservatory of Performing Art in Santa Monica, CA.She held a variety of jobs while pursuing her career, such as waitressing, and snagged a few stage roles before landing a supporting part in the Academy Award-nominated Reuben, Reuben (1983). This led to a lot of TV work and a lead role opposite Harrison Ford in the highly acclaimed thriller Свiдок (1985). This box office hit, directed by Peter Weir, got her noticed around Hollywood and producers took note of her. One of them was Jerry Bruckheimer, who cast her as Charlie Blackwood in the mega-hit Кращий стрiлець (1986) which became the highest-grossing film of the year and gave her some major name recognition.Ironically, that breakthrough role didn\'t help her career in terms of high-profile work. She played prosecutor Kathryn Murphy in The Accused (1988) with Jodie Foster who won an Academy Award for her role, but unfortunately for McGillis she was overlooked for any major nomination. Never interested in being box-office gold, she remained loyal to the theater, even after being established as a major star during the mid to late 1980s, taking such various stage roles in such William Shakespeare plays as \"The Merchant of Venice\", \"Don Juan\", \"Twelfth Night\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" and \"A Midsummer Night\'s Dream\". In 1994 she scored the title role in the Broadway production of \"Hedda Gabler\" but unfortunately it only played for 33 performances before closing.She had two daughters in the early 1990s, and worked more sporadically on TV and film so she could spend time with her family and owned her business, a restaurant in Florida. She worked on Winter People (1989), Cat Chaser (1989), The Babe (1992), North (1994), At First Sight (1999) and The Monkey\'s Mask (2000) as well as a string of made-for-TV films.She has completed a national stage tour of \"The Graduate\", playing the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and continues to act as she begins study on Addiction Studies and raising her children in Pennsylvania.'),(735,'Tim Curry','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTQ2OTYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEzMTA1._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Timothy James Curry was born on April 19, 1946 in Grappenhall, Cheshire, England.

However, for a child of Irish heritage surrounded by gifted parents and family, these were very natural traits. Maureen made her entrance into this caring haven on August 17, 1920, in Ranelagh (a suburb of Dublin), Ireland. Her mother, Marguerita Lilburn FitzSimons, was an accomplished contralto. Her father, Charles FitzSimons, managed a business in Dublin and also owned part of the renowned Irish soccer team \"The Shamrock Rovers\". Maureen was the second of six FitzSimons children - Peggy, Florrie, Charles B. Fitzsimons, Margot Fitzsimons and James O\'Hara completed this beautiful family.Maureen loved playing rough athletic games as a child and excelled in sports. She combined this interest with an equally natural gift for performing. This was demonstrated by her winning pretty much every Feis award for drama and theatrical performing her country offered. By age 14 she was accepted to the prestigious Abbey Theater and pursued her dream of classical theater and operatic singing. This course was to be altered, however, when Charles Laughton, after seeing a screen test of Maureen, became mesmerized by her hauntingly beautiful eyes. Before casting her to star in Jamaica Inn (1939), Laughton and his partner, Erich Pommer, changed her name from Maureen FitzSimons to \"Maureen O\'Hara\" - a bit shorter last name for the marquee.Under contract to Laughton, Maureen\'s next picture was to be filmed in America (The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939)) at RKO Pictures. The epic film was an extraordinary success and Maureen\'s contract was eventually bought from Laughton by RKO. At 19, Maureen had already starred in two major motion pictures with Laughton. Unlike most stars of her era, she started at the top, and remained there - with her skills and talents only getting better and better with the passing years.Maureen has an enviable string of all-time classics to her credit that include the aforementioned \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", Якою зеленою була тодi моя долина (1941), Диво на 34-й вулицi (1947), Sitting Pretty (1948), Тиха людина (1952), The Parent Trap (1961) and McLintock! (1963). Add to this the distinction of being voted one of the five most beautiful women in the world and you have a film star who was as gorgeous as she was talented.Although at times early in her career Hollywood didn\'t seem to notice, there was much more to Maureen O\'Hara than her dynamic beauty. She not only had a wonderful lyric soprano voice, but she could use her inherent athletic ability to perform physical feats that most actresses couldn\'t begin to attempt, from fencing to fisticuffs. She was a natural athlete.In her career Maureen starred with some of Hollywood\'s most dashing leading men, including Tyrone Power, John Payne, Rex Harrison, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Brian Keith, Sir Alec Guinness and, of course, her famed pairings with \"The Duke\" himself, John Wayne. She starred in five films with Wayne, the most beloved being Тиха людина (1952).In addition to famed director John Ford, Maureen was also fortunate to have worked for some other great directors in the business: Alfred Hitchcock, William Dieterle, Henry Hathaway, Henry King, Jean Renoir, John M. Stahl, William A. Wellman, Frank Borzage, Walter Lang, George Seaton, George Sherman, Carol Reed, Delmer Daves, David Swift, Andrew V. McLaglen and Chris Columbus.In 1968 Maureen found much deserved personal happiness when she married Charles Blair. Gen. Blair was a famous aviator whom she had known as a friend of her family for many years. A new career began for Maureen, that of a full-time wife. Her marriage to Blair, however, was again far from typical. Blair was the real-life version of what John Wayne had been on the screen. He had been a Brigadier General in the Air Force, a Senior Pilot with Pan American, and held many incredible record-breaking aeronautic achievements. Maureen happily retired from films in 1973 after making the TV movie The Red Pony (1973) (which won the prestigious Peabody Award for Excellence) with Henry Fonda. With Blair, Maureen managed Antilles Airboats, a commuter sea plane service in the Caribbean. She not only made trips around the world with her pilot husband, but owned and published a magazine, \"The Virgin Islander\", writing a monthly column called \"Maureen O\'Hara Says\".Tragically, Charles Blair died in a plane crash in 1978. Though completely devastated, Maureen pulled herself together and, with memories of ten of the happiest years of her life, continued on. She was elected President and CEO of Antilles Airboats, which brought her the distinction of being the first woman president of a scheduled airline in the United States.Fortunately, she was coaxed out of retirement several times - once in 1991 to star with John Candy in Only the Lonely (1991) and again, in 1995, in a made-for-TV movie, The Christmas Box (1995) on CBS. In the spring of 1998, Maureen accepted the second of what would be three projects for Polson Productions and CBS: Cab to Canada (1998) - and, in October, 2000, The Last Dance (2000).On November 4, 2014 Maureen was honored by a long overdue Oscar for \"Lifetime Achievement\" at the annual Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Governors Awards.Maureen O\'Hara was absolutely stunning, with that trademark red hair, dazzling smile and those huge, expressive eyes. She has fans from all over the world of all ages who are utterly devoted to her legacy of films and her persona as a strong, courageous and intelligent woman.'),(741,'Michael Keaton','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NTE2MzczOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTM4MjYz._V1_UY317_CR21,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Quirky, inventive and handsome American actor Michael Keaton first achieved major fame with his door-busting performance as fast-talking ideas man Bill Blazejowski, alongside a nerdish morgue attendant (Henry Winkler), in Night Shift (1982). He played further comedic roles in Mr. Mom (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984), and Бiтлджюс (1988), earned further acclaim for his dramatic portrayal of Bruce Wayne / Batman in Tim Burton\'s Бетмен (1989) and Бетмен повертаеться (1992), and since then, has moved easily between film genres, ranging from drama and romantic comedy to thriller and action.Keaton was born Michael John Douglas on September 5, 1951 in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, to Leona Elizabeth (Loftus), a homemaker, and George A. Douglas, a civil engineer and surveyor. He is of Irish, as well as English, Scottish, and German, descent. Michael studied speech for two years at Kent State, before dropping out and moving to Pittsburgh. An unsuccessful attempt at stand-up comedy led Keaton to working as a TV cameraman in a cable station, and he came to realize he wanted to work in front of the cameras. Keaton first appeared on TV in several episodes of MisteRogers\' Neighborhood (1968).He left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for TV. He began cropping up in popular TV shows including Maude (1972) and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979). Around this time, Keaton decided to use an alternative surname to remove confusion with better-known actor Michael Douglas. After reading an article on actress Diane Keaton, he decided that Michael Keaton sounded good. His next break was scoring a co-starring role alongside Jim Belushi in the short-lived comedy series Working Stiffs (1979), which showcased his comedic talent and led to his co-starring role in Night Shift (1982). Keaton next scored the lead in the comedy hits Mr. Mom (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984) , Gung Ho (1986), the Tim Burton horror-comedy Бiтлджюс (1988), and The Dream Team (1989).Keaton\'s career was given another major boost when he was again cast by Tim Burton, this time as the title comic book superhero, millionaire playboy / crime-fighter Bruce Wayne, in Бетмен (1989). Burton cast him because he thought that Keaton was the only actor who could portray someone who has the kind of darkly obsessive personality that the character demands. To say there were howls of protest by fans of the caped crusader comic strip is an understatement! Warner Bros. was deluged with thousands of letters of complaint commenting that comedian Keaton was the wrong choice for the Caped Crusader, given his prior work and the fact that he lacked the suave, handsome features and tall, muscular physicality often attributed to the character in the comic books. However, their fears were proven wrong when Keaton turned in a sensational performance, and he held his own on screen with opponent Jack Nicholson, playing the lunatic villain, \"The Joker\". Keaton\'s dramatic work earned widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and Бетмен (1989) became one of the most successful films of the year.Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films. Keen to diversify his work, Keaton starred as a psychotic tenant in Pacific Heights (1990), as a hard-working cop in One Good Cop (1991), and then donned the black cape and cowl once more for Бетмен повертаеться (1992). He remained in demand during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including the star-studded Shakespearian Багато галасу з нiчого (1993), the drama My Life (1993), another Ron Howard comedy Газета (1994), with sexy Andie MacDowell in Я i моi клони (1996), twice in the same role, dogged Elmore Leonard character Agent Ray Nicolette, in Джекi Браун (1997) and Поза полем зору (1998). He also played a killer in the mediocre thriller Desperate Measures (1998).In the 2000s, Keaton appeared in several productions with mixed success, including Live from Baghdad (2002), First Daughter (2004), and Herbie Fully Loaded (2005). He also provided voices for characters in the animated films Тачки (2006), Iсторiя iграшок 3 (2010), and Посiпаки (2015).He returned to major film roles in the 2010s, co-starring in Копи на пiдхватi (2010), РобоКоп (2014) and Need for Speed: Жага швидкостi (2014). Also that year, Keaton starred alongside Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts in Бердмен (2014), a film by 21 грам (2003) and Biutiful (2010) director Alejandro G. Iñárritu. In the film, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a screen actor, famous for playing the iconic titular superhero, who puts on a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver short story, to regain his former glory. Keaton\'s critically praised lead performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, the Critics\' Choice Award for Best Actor and Best Actor in a Comedy, and nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award, British Academy Film Award, and Academy Award for Best Actor.In 2015, he played a journalist in У центрi уваги (2015), which, like Birdman, won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

He grew up amid the happening Hollywood scene with big brother Beau Bridges. Both boys popped up, without billing, alongside their mother in the film The Company She Keeps (1951), and appeared on occasion with their famous dad on his popular underwater TV series Sea Hunt (1958) while growing up. At age 14, Jeff toured with his father in a stage production of \"Anniversary Waltz\". The \"troublesome teen\" years proved just that for Jeff and his parents were compelled at one point to intervene when problems with drugs and marijuana got out of hand.He recovered and began shaping his nascent young adult career appearing on TV as a younger version of his father in the acclaimed TV- movie Silent Night, Lonely Night (1969), and in the strange Burgess Meredith film The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go (1978). Following fine notices for his portrayal of a white student caught up in the racially-themed Halls of Anger (1970), his career-maker arrived just a year later when he earned a coming-of-age role in the critically-acclaimed ensemble film Останнiй кiносеанс (1971). The Peter Bogdanovich- directed film made stars out off its young leads (Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd) and Oscar winners out of its older cast (Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman). The part of Duane Jackson, for which Jeff received his first Oscar-nomination (for \"best supporting actor\"), set the tone for the types of roles Jeff would acquaint himself with his fans -- rambling, reckless, rascally and usually unpredictable).Owning a casual carefree handsomeness and armed with a perpetual grin and sly charm, he started immediately on an intriguing 70s sojourn into offbeat filming. Chief among them were his boxer on his way up opposite a declining Stacy Keach in Fat City (1972); his Civil War-era conman in the western Bad Company (1972); his redneck stock car racer in The Last American Hero (1973); his young student anarchist opposite a stellar veteran cast in Eugene O\'Neill\'s The Iceman Cometh (1973); his bank-robbing (also Oscar-nominated) sidekick to Clint Eastwood in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974); his aimless cattle rustler in Rancho Deluxe (1975); his low-level western writer who wants to be a real-life cowboy in Hearts of the West (1975); and the brother of an assassinated President who pursues leads to the crime in Winter Kills (1979). All are simply marvelous characters that should have propelled him to the very top rungs of stardom...but strangely didn\'t.Perhaps it was his trademark ease and naturalistic approach that made him somewhat under appreciated at that time when Hollywood was run by a Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino-like intensity. Neverthless, Jeff continued to be a scene-stealing favorite into the next decade, notably as the video game programmer in the 1982 science-fiction cult classic Трон (1982), and the struggling musician brother vying with brother Beau Bridges over the attentions of sexy singer Michelle Pfeiffer in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989). Jeff became a third-time Oscar nominee with his highly intriguing (and strangely sexy) portrayal of a blank-faced alien in Зоряний чоловiк (1984), and earned even higher regard as the ever-optimistic inventor Preston Tucker in Tucker: The Man and His Dream (1988).Since then Jeff has continued to pour on the Bridges magic on film. Few enjoy such an enduring popularity while maintaining equal respect with the critics. Король-Рибалка (1991), American Heart (1992), Fearless (1993), Великий Лебовськi (1998) (now a cult phenomenon) and Претендент (2000) (which gave him a fourth Oscar nomination) are prime examples. More recently he seized the moment as a bald-pated villain as Robert Downey Jr.\'s nemesis in Залiзна людина (2008) and then, at age 60, he capped his rewarding career by winning the elusive Oscar, plus the Golden Globe and Screen Actor Guild awards (among many others), for his down-and-out country singer Bad Blake in Шалене серце (2009). Bridges next starred in Трон: Спадок (2010), reprising one of his more famous roles, and received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his role in the Western remake Справжня мужнiсть (2010). In 2014, he co-produced and starred in an adaptation of the Lois Lowry science fiction drama Втаемничений (2014).Jeff has been married since 1977 to non-professional Susan Geston (they met on the set of Rancho Deluxe (1975)). The couple have three daughters, Isabelle (born 1981), Jessica (born 1983), and Hayley (born 1985).

It was on one such trip at the age of eighteen, that Sevigny was spotted on the street by a fashion editor for Sassy magazine. Impressed by her flair for street fashion, the editors of the progressive teen mag asked Sevigny to intern in their offices which led to a few modeling jobs with both Sassy and x-girl, the urban clothing line created by Sonic Youth front woman Kim Gordon. At this time Sevigny also spent a lot of her time watching the skateboarders who convened in New York\'s Tompkins square park. It was here that she met young aspiring director Harmony Korine, and a friendship ensued, resulting in her being cast as the lead in Korine and Larry Clark\'s collaboration Дiтки (1995). At around the same time Sevigny snagged the cover of Interview magazine, and even inspired writer Jay McInerney to write a piece about her for The New Yorker in which he hailed her the new \"it girl.\" The late nineties saw Sevigny continuing her acting career with a string of independent films, among them Trees Lounge (1996), Palmetto (1998), and Whit Stillman\'s homage to early 80s yuppiedom The Last Days of Disco (1998). In 1997 Sevigny and Korine teamed up again to make Gummo (1997), in which Sevigny both starred and acted as chief costume designer. It was in 2000 however that Sevigny\'s career made a turn towards more mainstream recognition when her portrayal of Lana Tisdel in Хлопцi не плачуть (1999) garnered her an Oscar nod at the age of twenty-five.

Tantalizingly wet with her garb clinging to all the right amazonian places, One Million Years B.C. (1966), if nothing else, captured the hearts and libidos of modern men (not to mention their teenage sons) while producing THE most definitive and best-selling pin-up poster of that time. After a major dry spell following the death of Marilyn Monroe in 1962, the auburn-maned Ms. Welch effortlessly assumed Marilyn\'s place and forever wiped away the notion that enduring sex goddesses came only in one form -- bottled blonds.She was born Jo Raquel Tejada on September 5, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois, the first of three children born to Bolivian Armando Carlos Tejada Urquizo, an aerospace engineer, and his Irish-American wife Josephine Sarah Hall, who was the daughter of American architect Emery Stanford Hall (1869-1939) and his wife Clara Louise Adams. The family moved to San Diego, California (her father was transferred) when Raquel was only two. Taking dance lessons as a youngster, she grew up to be quite a knockout and nailed a number of teen beauty titles (\"Miss Photogenic,\" \"Miss La Jolla,\" \"Miss Contour,\" \"Miss Fairest of the Fair\" and \"Miss San Diego\"). With her sights set on theater arts, she studied at San Diego State College on a scholarship starting in 1958 and married her first husband, high school sweetheart James Welch, the following year. They had two children Damon Welch (born 1959) and Tahnee Welch (born 1961). Tahnee went on to take advantage of her own stunning looks as an actress, most notably a prime featured role in Cocoon (1985).Off campus Raquel became a local TV weather girl in San Diego and eventually quit college. Following the end of her marriage in 1962 (she and Welch didn\'t divorce until 1964), she packed up her two children and moved to Dallas, Texas, where she modeled for Neiman-Marcus and worked as a barmaid for a time. Regrouping, she returned to California, migrated to Los Angeles, and made the rounds of film/TV auditions. Providing minor but sexy set decoration on the small screen (Bewitched (1964), McHale\'s Navy (1962) and The Virginian (1962)) as well as the large (Elvis Presley\'s Roustabout (1964) and Doris Day\'s Do Not Disturb (1965)). Caught in the midst of the \"beach party\" craze, it\'s not surprising to find out that her first prime film role was A Swingin\' Summer (1965), which concentrated more on musical guests The Righteous Brothers and Gary Lewis & The Playboys than on Raquel\'s outstanding contributions. But 20th Century Fox certainly took notice and signed her up.With her very first film under contract (actually, she was on loan out to Britain\'s Hammer Studios at the time), she took on the remake of One Million B.C. (1940) in the Carole Landis role and the rest is history. Raquel remained an international celebrity in her first few years of stardom. In England, she was quite revealing as the deadly sin representing \"lust\" for the comedy team of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore in their vehicle Bedazzled (1967), and as the title secret agent in the sexy spy spoof Fathom (1967). In Italy, she gained some exposure in primarily mediocre vehicles opposite such heartthrobs as Marcello Mastroianni. Back in the U.S., however, she caused quite a stir in her groundbreaking sex scenes with black athlete Jim Brown in the \"spaghetti western\" 100 Rifles (1969), and as the transgendered title role in the unfathomable Myra Breckinridge (1970). Adapted from Gore Vidal novel, she created some unwelcome notoriety by locking horns with aging diva Mae West on the set. The instant cult movie was a laughingstock to all concerned and certainly didn\'t help Raquel\'s attempt at being taking seriously as an actress.Box office bombs abounded. Try as she might in such films as Kansas City Bomber (1972) and The Wild Party (1975), which drew some good reviews for her, her sexy typecast gave her little room to breathe. With determination, however, she partly offset this with modest supporting roles in larger ensemble pieces. She showed definite spark and won a Golden Globe for the swashbuckler Три мушкетери (1973), and appeared to good advantage in the mystery thriller The Last of Sheila (1973). She planned on making a comeback in Cannery Row (1982), even agreeing to appear topless (which she had never done before), but was suddenly fired during production without notice. She sued MGM for breach of contract and ultimately won a $15 million settlement, but it didn\'t help her film career and only helped to label her as trouble on a set. TV movies became a positive milieu for Raquel as she developed sound vehicles for herself such as The Legend of Walks Far Woman (1982) and Right to Die (1987). She also found a lucrative avenue pitching beauty products in infomercials and developing exercise videos à la Jane Fonda.Raquel took advantage of her modest singing and dancing abilities by performing in splashy Las Vegas showrooms and starring in such plausible stage vehicles as \"Woman of the Year\" and \"Victor/Victoria.\" Still a dazzler broaching age 70, Raquel continues to show up here and there and still can turn heads. She has even spoofed her own diva image on occasion, most memorably on Сайнфелд (1989). More recently she has co-starred in the Hispanic-oriented TV series American Family (2002) and in the short-lived comedy Welcome to the Captain (2008), and appeared in the movies Tortilla Soup (2001), Бiлявка в законi (2001) and Forget About It (2006). She is separated from her fourth husband Richie Palmer, who is 14 years her junior.'),(764,'Vincent D\'Onofrio','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTE2MDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODUzMjcz._V1_UY317_CR6,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','2019-08-27','Vincent Phillip D\'Onofrio was born on June 30, 1959 in Brooklyn, New York, to Phyllis, a restaurant manager and server, and Gene D\'Onofrio, a theatre production assistant and interior designer. He is of Italian descent and has two older sisters. He studied at the Actors Studio and the American Stanislavski Theatre. Vincent D\'Onofrio is known as an \"actor\'s actor\". The wide variety of roles he has played and the quality of his work have earned him a reputation as a versatile talent.His first paid role was in Off-Broadway\'s \"This Property Is Condemned\". He continued appearing in plays and worked as a bouncer, a bodyguard and a delivery man. In 1984, he made his Broadway debut in \"Open Admissions\", followed by work in numerous other stage plays. In 2012, D\'Onofrio returned to teach at the Lee Strasberg Theater & Film Institute. As a film actor, D\'Onofrio\'s career break came when he played a mentally unbalanced recruit in Цiлiсно-металева оболонка (1987), directed by the renowned Stanley Kubrick. For this role D\'Onofrio gained nearly 70 pounds. He had a major role in Dying Young (1991), and appeared prominently in the box-office smash Люди в чорному (1997) as the bad guy (Edgar \"The Bug\").Other films of note in which he has appeared are Mystic Pizza (1988), JFK (1991), Гравець (1992), Ед Вуд (1994), Клiтка (2000), The Break-Up (2006) and Свiт Юрського перiоду (2015).

He also made a guest appearance in Homicide: Life on the Street: The Subway (1997), where he played an accident victim who could not be rescued and was destined to die. For this performance he won an Emmy nomination. In 2000, he both produced and starred in Steal This Movie (2000), a biopic of radical leader Abbie Hoffman.In 2001, D\'Onofrio took the role which has likely given him his greatest public recognition: Det. Robert Goren, the lead character in the TV series Закон i порядок: Злочиннi намiри (2001). Goren is based on Sherlock Holmes but, instead of relying upon physical evidence like Holmes, D\'Onofrio\'s character focuses on psychology to identify the perpetrators, whom he often draws into confessing or yielding condemning evidence. He played the part for 10 years.In his career D\'Onofrio\'s various film characters have included a priest, a bisexual former porn star, a hijacker, a serial killer, Orson Welles, a space alien, a 1960s radical leader, a pulp fiction writer, an ingenious police investigator and Stuart Smalley\'s dope-head brother. His on-screen love interests have included Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, Renée Zellweger, Marisa Tomei, Tracey Ullman, Rebecca De Mornay and Lili Taylor.

He transferred to State University of New York College at Oneonta where he received his BA in Theater. He received both his MFA in Theater/Directing and an honorary PHD from University of Massachusetts at Amherst. While teaching Directing at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, one of Bill\'s students was the soon-to-be film director John Dahl, who later cast Mr. Pullman in \"The Last Seduction\".Moving to New York City, he worked with Kathy Bates in the acclaimed stage production of \"Curse of the Starving Class\". However, it was his first work in three strikingly diverse films that brought him to the attention of his audience: \"Ruthless People\" with Danny DeVito and Bette Milder, the Mel Brooks hit \"Spaceballs\" and the Oscar-nominated (and winner for Best Supporting Actress Geena Davis) \"The Accidental Tourist\". Still attracted to the art and study of building construction, Bill has designed and/or restored three \"barns\": In Montana, he converted a 1933 barn at his ranch into his family home. In Los Angeles, he built a Truss barn in the style of LA\'s 1910 fruit storage barns. In western New York State, he restored a \'3-bay\' barn that sometimes serves as a community center near his hometown of Hornell, New York. Focused more on neighborhoods than show business-based charities and societies, Pullman has defined himself by his work with his local communities. He works to bridge communities of Los Angeles through his board work with Cornerstone Theater. Pullman continues to work with his neighbors who formed \"Concerned Citizens Montana\" to secure a place at the table regarding the national need for a smart grid for energy transmission.

His father is Filipino, and his mother has Greek ancestry.When WCW officials told him he\'d never make it in sports entertainment, Bautista pushed himself to achieve his dream of being a Superstar. In May 2002, he made his debut on SmackDown using the ring name Batista, but it wasn\'t until a move to Raw and two victories over Kane that \"The Animal\" began to make noise in the WWE Universe. The wins impressed Ric Flair and Triple H, who were looking to align themselves with the industry\'s brightest new stars. After a lengthy search, they identified Randy Orton and Batista. Collectively the four Superstars became known as Evolution.Batista earned his first championship alongside \"The Nature Boy\" when the duo captured the WWE Tag Team Championships in December 2003. As Evolution dominated WWE, Batista started to emerge from the shadows of Triple H and Ric Flair. By the time Batista won the 2005 Royal Rumble Match, World Heavyweight Champion Triple H viewed him as a serious threat to his title.After a triceps injury at the hands of Mark Henry forced Batista to relinquish the title in January 2006, he vowed to return. Batista successfully regained the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series in 2006. Four months into his second reign, Batista faced the Undertaker at WrestleMania 23. \"The Animal\" took Undertaker to the limit, but was unable to stop the streak of \"The Deadman\" at WrestleMania. Though disappointed, Batista stayed hungry and always managed to keep himself in the championship hunt for the rest of his career.At Bragging Rights in 2009, Batista shocked the world when he blamed Rey Mysterio for a loss to Undertaker, then attacked his former tag team partner. \"The Animal\" then became locked in a tense rivalry with another former friend, John Cena, over the WWE Championship. The grueling match at Over the Limit led to a wheelchair-bound Batista declaring \"I quit!\" the following night on Raw before fading from the WWE Universe in May 2010. Following his departure from WWE, Bautista appeared opposite Vin Diesel in the Universal film Рiддiк (2013) and RZA\'s feature directorial debut The Man with the Iron Fists (2012), in which he played the villainous Brass Body and starred opposite Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu. His other film credits include The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption (2012), where he played Argomael; the action film House of the Rising Sun (2011); and Wrong Side of Town (2010) opposite rapper Ja Rule.Two years later, he joined MMA and won his first professional MMA fight. In January 2014, he made his long awaited return to the WWE, before quitting a second time in June of that same year. He did this in order to promote Вартовi Галактики (2014), which was released on August 1, 2014, and starred Chris Pratt, Benicio Del Toro, Zoe Saldana, and Djimon Hounsou, alongside Bautista.He will shoot Kickboxer: Vengeance (2016), directed by John Stockwell, and co-starring martial artist Alain Moussi and UFC fighter Georges St-Pierre. The remake of the 1989 Jean-Claude Van Damme film, Kickboxer (1989) is about two brothers David and Kurt Sloan; When David wins the Karate World Championship, a promoter lures him to Hong Kong, despite his brother\'s protestations that the man is a crook. When Kurt travels to Thailand to meet his brother, he discovers he has died and seeks his revenge.After starring in films such as, Вартовi Галактики 2 (2017), Той, хто бiжить по лезу 2049 (2017), Месники: Вiйна нескiнченностi (2018), Готель Артемiда (2018), Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018), and Final Score (2018), he made a special guest appearance on WWF SmackDown! (1999) for it\'s 1000 episode reuniting with his former Evolution members Triple H, Randy Orton, and Ric Flair on October 16, 2018. The following year on February 25, 2019, he made his return to WWE Monday Night RAW (1993) when he attacked Ric Flair on his 70th birthday at the end of the episode sending a message to Triple H that would ultimately lead to a No Holds Barred match for WrestleMania 35 (2019). Batista added the stipulation that if he wins the match, Triple H will have to retire from in-ring competition. As a result, Triple H was finally able to beat Batista for the first time and won the match, which ultimately led to Batista announcing his official retirement from wrestling in the WWE. Following his retirement, he will continue with his career as an actor in Hollywood.His next films scheduled for release will be; Водiй для копа (2019), Месники: Завершення (2019), План втечi 3 (2019), and My Spy (2020).

At the age of 10, he appeared in his first play, \"In My Many Names and Days,\" at a cramped little theater space in Manhattan. He continued on but managed to avoid the trappings of a child star per se, considering himself more a working child actor at the time. Billing himself as Larry Fishburne during this early phase, he never studied or was trained in the technique of acting. In 1973, at the age of 12, Laurence won a recurring role on the daytime soap One Life to Live (1968) that lasted three seasons and subsequently made his film debut in the ghetto-themed Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975). At 14 Francis Ford Coppola cast him in Апокалiпсис наших днiв (1979), which filmed for two years in the Philippines. Laurence didn\'t work for another year and a half after that long episode. A graduate of Lincoln Square Academy, Coppola was impressed enough with Laurence to hire him again down the line with featured roles in Rumble Fish (1983), The Cotton Club (1984), and Gardens of Stone (1987).Throughout the 1980s, he continued to build up his film and TV credit list with featured roles despite little fanfare. A recurring role as Cowboy Curtis on the kiddie show Pee-wee\'s Playhouse (1986) helped him through whatever lean patches there were at the time. With the new decade (1990s) came out-and-out stardom for Laurence. A choice lead in John Singleton\'s urban tale Хлопцi на районi (1991) catapulted him immediately into the front of the film ranks. Set in LA\'s turbulent South Central area, his potent role as a morally minded divorced father who strives to rise above the ignorance and violence of his surroundings, Laurence showed true command and the ability to hold up any film. On stage, he would become invariably linked to playwright August Wilson and his 20th Century epic African-American experience after starring for two years as the eruptive ex-con in \"Two Training Running.\" For this powerful, mesmerizing performance, Laurence won nearly every prestigious theater award in the books (Tony, Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk and Theatre World). It was around the time of this career hallmark that he began billing himself as \"Laurence\" instead of \"Larry.\" More awards and accolades came his way. In addition to an Emmy for the pilot episode of the series \"Tribeca,\" he was nominated for his fine work in the quality mini-movies The Tuskegee Airmen (1995) and Miss Evers\' Boys (1997).On the larger screen, both Laurence and Angela Bassett were given Oscar nominations for their raw, seething portrayals of rock stars Ike and Tina Turner in the film What\'s Love Got to Do with It (1993). To his credit, he managed to take an extremely repellent character and make it a sobering and captivating experience. A pulp box-office favorite as well, he originated the role of Morpheus, Keanu Reeves\' mentor, in the exceedingly popular futuristic sci-fi Матриця (1999), best known for its ground-breaking special effects. He wisely returned for its back-to-back sequels. Into the millennium, Laurence extended his talents by making his screenwriting and directorial debut in Once in the Life (2000), in which he also starred. The film is based on his own critically acclaimed play \"Riff Raff,\" which he staged five years earlier. In 1999, he scored a major theater triumph with a multi-racial version of \"The Lion in Winter\" as Henry II opposite Stockard Channing\'s Eleanor of Acquitaine. On film, Fishburne has appeared in a variety of interesting roles in not-always-successful films. Never less than compelling, a few of his more notable parts include an urban speed chess player in У пошуках Боббi Фiшера (1993); a military prisoner in Cadence (1990); a college professor in Singleton\'s Higher Learning (1995); a CIA operative in Bad Company (1995); the title role in Othello (1995) (he was the first black actor to play the part on film); a spaceship rescue team leader in the sci-fi horror Event Horizon (1997); a Depression-era gangster in Hoodlum (1997); a dogged police sergeant in Clint Eastwood\'s Таeмнича рiчка (2003); a spelling bee coach in Akeelah and the Bee (2006); and prominent roles in the mainstream films Хижаки (2010) and Зараза (2011). He returned occasionally to the theatre. In April 2008, he played Thurgood Marshall in the one-man show \"Thurgood\" and won a Drama Desk Award. It was later transferred to the screen.In the fall of 2008, Fishburne replaced William Petersen as the male lead investigator on the popular CBS drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000), but left the show in 2011 to refocus on films and was in turn replaced by Ted Danson. Since then Fishburne has appeared in the Superman film Людина зi сталi (2013) as Daily Planet chief Perry White.Fishburne has two children, Langston and Montana, from his first marriage to actress Hajna O.

In 1965, he moved to London and joined the National Theatre, invited by Laurence Olivier, who could see the talent in Hopkins. In 1967, he made his first film for television, A Flea in Her Ear (1967).From this moment on, he enjoyed a successful career in cinema and television. In 1968, he worked on Лев узимку (1968) with Timothy Dalton. Many successes came later, and Hopkins\' remarkable acting style reached the four corners of the world.

She is the oldest daughter of Michael and Suzie Wilson, with three elder brothers - Danny (b. 1979), Jon (b. 1981) and Joel (b. 1983) - and a younger sister Anna (b. 1993). When Mara was 5 years old, her eldest brother Daniel Ben Wilson (Danny) started acting in television commercials and she wanted to follow in his footsteps. Her parents refused to let her act at first. After continuous persistence from Mara Elizabeth, her parents reluctantly agreed to let her give acting a try. She went on to appear in a number of commercials, including those advertising Texaco and the Bank of America. She also appeared in Мiсiс Даутфайр (1993), starring Robin Williams and Sally Field, as the divorced parents. In her role, Mara proved herself to be a talented young actress, who was mature for her tender years, and her acting career went from strength-to-strength as she quickly became a favorite among cinema-goers. The following year, Mara played a small girl whose mother had suffered a major stroke in A Time to Heal (1994). But her big break came with the remake of Диво на 34-й вулицi (1994), as the little, intelligent, cynical girl who learned the magic of Santa Claus. Ironically, Mara was not raised to believe in Santa Claus but this was a bonus in some ways since she was able to empathize with her character\'s stance that there was no Santa. At the age of nine, Mara was cast in the lead role in the film adaptation of Roald Dahls book, Матильда (1996). Sadly, during filming, Mara lost her beloved mother to breast cancer but she bravely pushed ahead with the film, much to the amazement and admiration of her adult co-stars. Mara starred in three films over the following three years, the last of which was in Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000). Unfortunately, the film did not do well in the theaters of American box office, but it did very well in the UK box office. This signaled an end to Mara\'s film career, as she wanted to focus on school and to enjoy her teenage years. In June 2005, Mara graduated from Idyllwild School of Music & Arts and went on to attend New York University. In a March 2012 blog post, she revealed she has no desire to return to acting in films.

Since then, as a producer and as an actor-producer, he has shown an uncanny knack for choosing projects that reflect changing trends and public concerns. Over the years, he has been involved in such controversial and politically influential motion pictures as Пролiтаючи над гнiздом зозулi (1975), Китайський синдром (1979) and Трафiк (2000), and such popular films as Фатальний потяг (1987) and Роман з каменем (1984).Michael Douglas was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to actors Diana Douglas (Diana Love Dill) and Kirk Douglas (born Issur Danielovitch). His paternal grandparents were Belarusian Jewish immigrants, while his mother was born in Bermuda, the daughter of a local Attorney General, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Melville Dill; Diana\'s family had long been established in both Bermuda and the United States. Douglas\'s parents divorced when he was six, and he went to live with his mother and her new husband. Only seeing Kirk on holidays, Michael attended Eaglebrook school in Deerfield, Massachusetts, where he was about a year younger than all of his classmates.Douglas attended the elite preparatory Choate School and spent his summers with his father on movie sets. Although accepted at Yale, Douglas attended the University of California, Santa Barbara. Deciding he wanted to be an actor in his teenage years, Michael often asked his father about getting a \"foot in the door\". Kirk was strongly opposed to Michael pursuing an acting career, saying that it was an industry with many downs and few ups, and that he wanted all four of his sons to stay out of it. Michael, however, was persistent, and made his film debut in his father\'s film Cast a Giant Shadow (1966).After receiving his B.A. degree in 1968, Douglas moved to New York City to continue his dramatic training, studying at the American Place Theatre with Wynn Handman, and at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where he appeared in workshop productions of Pirandello\'s Six Characters in Search of an Author (1976) and Thornton Wilder\'s Happy Journey (1963). A few months after he arrived in New York, Douglas got his first big break, when he was cast in the pivotal role of the free-spirited scientist who compromises his liberal views to accept a lucrative job with a high-tech chemical corporation in the CBS Playhouse production of Ellen M. Violett\'s drama, The Experiment, which was televised nationwide on February 25, 1969.Douglas\' convincing portrayal won him the leading role in the adaptation of John Weston\'s controversial novel, Hail, Hero! (1969), which was the initial project of CBS\'s newly organized theatrical film production company, Cinema Center Films. Douglas starred as a well-meaning, almost saintly young pacifist determined not only to justify his beliefs to his conservative parents but also to test them under fire in the jungles of Indochina. His second feature, Adam at Six A.M. (1970) concerned a young man\'s search for his roots. Douglas next appeared in the film version of Ron Cowen\'s play Summertree (1971), produced by \'Kirk Douglas\'\' Bryna Company, and then Napoleon and Samantha (1972), a sentimental children\'s melodrama from the Walt Disney studio.In between film assignments, he worked in summer stock and off-Broadway productions, among them \"City Scenes\", Frank Gagliano\'s surrealistic vignettes of contemporary life in New York, John Patrick Shanley\'s short-lived romance \"Love is a Time of Day\" and George Tabori\'s \"Pinkville\", in which he played a young innocent brutalized by his military training. He also appeared in the made-for-television thriller, \"When Michael Calls\", broadcast by ABC-TV on February 5, 1972 and in episodes of the popular series \"Medical Center\" and \"The FBI\".Impressed by Douglas\' performance in a segment of The F.B.I. (1965), producer \'Quinn Martin\' signed the actor for the part of Karl Malden\'s sidekick in the police series \"The Streets of San Francisco\", which premiered September of 1972 and became one of ABC\'s highest-rated prime-time programs in the mid-1970s. Douglas earned three successive Emmy Award nominations for his performance and he directed two episodes of the series.During the annual breaks in the shooting schedule for The Streets of _San Francisco (1972)_, Douglas devoted most of his time to his film production company, Big Stick Productions, Ltd., which produced several short subjects in the early 1970s. Long interested in producing a film version of Ken Kesey\'s grimly humorous novel Пролiтаючи над гнiздом зозулi (1975), Douglas purchased the movie rights from his father and began looking for financial backing. After a number of major motion picture studios turned him down, Douglas formed a partnership with Saul Zaentz, a record industry executive, and the two set about recruiting the cast and crew. Douglas still had a year to go on his contract for \"The Streets of San Francisco\", but the producers agreed to write his character out of the story so that he could concentrate on filming \"Cuckoo\'s Nest\".A critical and commercial success, Пролiтаючи над гнiздом зозулi (1975) won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Actress, and went on to gross more than $180 million at the box office. Douglas suddenly found himself in demand as an independent producer. One of the many scripts submitted to him for consideration was Mike Gray\'s chilling account of the attempted cover-up of an accident at a nuclear power plant. Attracted by the combination of social relevance and suspense, Douglas immediately bought the property. Deemed not commercial by most investors, Douglas teamed up with Jane Fonda and her own motion picture production company, IPC Films.A Michael Douglas-IPC Films co-production, Китайський синдром (1979) starred Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda, and \'Michael Douglas\' and received Academy Award nominations for Lemmon and Fonda, as well as for Best Screenplay. The National Board of Review named the film one of the best films of the year.Despite his success as a producer, Douglas resumed his acting career in the late 1970s, starring in Michael Crichton\'s medical thriller Coma (1978) with Genevieve Bujold, Claudia Weill\'s feminist comedy It\'s My Turn (1980) starring Jill Clayburgh, and Peter Hyams\' gripping tale of modern-day vigilante justice, \"The Star Chamber\" (1983). Douglas also starred in Running (1979), as a compulsive quitter who sacrifices everything to take one last shot at the Olympics, and as Zach the dictatorial director/choreographer in Richard Attenborough\'s screen version of the Broadway\'s longest running musical A Chorus Line (1985).Douglas\' career as an actor/producer came together again in 1984 with the release of the tongue-in-cheek romantic fantasy \"Romancing the Stone\". Douglas had begun developing the project several years earlier, and with Kathleen Turner as Joan Wilder, the dowdy writer of gothic romances, Danny DeVito as the feisty comic foil Ralphie and Douglas as Jack Colton, the reluctant soldier of fortune, \"Romancing\" was a resounding hit and grossed more than $100 million at the box office. Douglas was named Producer of the Year in 1984 by the National Association of Theater Owners. Douglas, Turner and DeVito reteamed in 1985 for the successful sequel Перлина Нiлу (1985).It took Douglas nearly two years to convince Columbia Pictures executives to approve the production of Зоряний чоловiк (1984), an unlikely tale of romance between an extraterrestrial, played by \'Jeff Bridges\', and a young widow, played by Karen Allen. Зоряний чоловiк (1984) was the sleeper hit of the 1984 Christmas season and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for \'Jeff Bridges\'.

Her father\'s ancestry is Italian, and her mother is of Irish and Slovak descent. Her father moved the family back to Edison, New Jersey as a native New Yorker and to be closer to other siblings from previous marriages. While dining out one night in the presence of Hollywood royalty, Brittany at the age of 5 approached an adjoining table when Academy Award nominee Burt Reynolds and George Segal were seated. Brittany introduced herself to the Hollywood legends and confidently told them that someday she too would be a star.She comes from a long line of international musicians and performers with three half-brothers and a sister. Angelo Bertolotti was torn from their tight-knit family as a made-man with the Italian Mafia. The Senior Bertolotti, who coined the nickname of \"Britt\" for his daughter, was also an entrepreneur and diplomat for organized crime families and one of the first to be subjected to a RICO prosecution. Brittany\'s interests and well-being were always her father\'s first goal and objective. To distance his talented daughter from his infamous past, Angelo allowed Sharon to use her maiden name for Brittany\'s, so that her shining star would not be overshadowed by a father\'s past, with the couple divorcing thereafter.Brittany began receiving accolades and applause in regional theater at the early age of 9. At the age of 13, she landed several national commercials. She appeared on television and caught the attention of a personal manager and an agent. Soon, Brittany\'s mother Sharon turned full-time to being a \"Stage Mom\" where Angelo provided financial support throughout and their relationship is memorialized with a long and close history in pictures. The hopeful daughter and mother moved to Burbank, CA, where Brittany landed her first television role on Blossom (1990). Hearts and doors opened up for a starring role on Drexell\'s Class (1991), a short lived TV series.Brittany\'s big screen movie debut started with Безголовi (1995), where she was co-starring with Alicia Silverstone. Britt soared, demonstrating her musical and artistic talents with dramatic and comedic roles landing a nomination for best leading female performance in the Young Artist Awards for her role in the television film David and Lisa (1998). She garnered tremendous attention for her role in Перерване життя (1999) with Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie. Brittany\'s band, \"Blessed Soul\" was growing with her as lead singer and Britt lent her vocal talents to the TV hit, cartoon sensation, Король гори (1997) as the voice of Luanne.She is alleged to have been a witness in the case of the former Department of Homeland Security employee and persecuted whistleblower Julia Davis. According to Davis, Brittany and her fiancée Simon Monjack were then targeted for retaliation that included land and aerial surveillance and a threatened prosecution. Monjack was arrested and detained by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Brittany and Simon confided in Alex Ben Block of the Hollywood Reporter, telling him in an interview that they were under surveillance by helicopters and their telephones have been wiretapped. This information was published by THR posthumously, in an article entitled \"The Last Difficult Days of Brittany Murphy.\"On December 20, 2009, Brittany Murphy died an untimely death. The LAPD and Los Angeles County Coroner closed the case within one hour, attributing her death to pneumonia and anemia. Five months after Brittany\'s unexpected demise, her husband Simon Monjack was found dead in the house he shared with Brittany. The chief/spokesperson at the Los Angeles County Dept of Coroner, Craig Harvey, stated that Simon also died from the same exact causes as his wife, namely pneumonia and anemia. Neither Brittany, nor Simon, were given a thorough and complete forensic autopsy for poisons. Brittany\'s father, Angelo \"AJ\" Bertolotti, is pursuing the investigation of the true reasons behind Brittany\'s and Simon\'s sudden demise, as he believes that the two were murdered. Abnormally high levels of heavy metals and poisons were discovered in Brittany\'s hair, tested by two other independent forensic labs with famed Pathologist, attorney Cyril Wecht concluded from the appearances, Brittany could have been murdered and should be exhumed.

A year later, his mother married Eugene Addis, a Miami Beach police officer, and moved to Miami Shores, Florida. After graduating from Horace Mann Junior High School, Rourke\'s family moved to a house located on 47th Street and Prairie Avenue in Miami Beach.

He took up self-defense training at the Boys Club of Miami. It was there he learned boxing skills and decided on an amateur career. At the age of 12, Rourke won his first boxing match as an 118-pound bantamweight, defeating Javier Villanueva. Some of his early matches were fought as Andre Rourke.

He spent most of his childhood as a recluse, drawing cartoons, and watching old movies (he was especially fond of films with Vincent Price). When he was in the ninth grade, his artistic talent was recognized by a local garbage company, when he won a prize for an anti-litter poster he designed. The company placed this poster on all of their garbage trucks for a year. After graduating from high school, he attended California Institute of the Arts. Like so many others who graduated from that school, Burton\'s first job was as an animator for Disney.His early film career was fueled by almost unbelievable good luck, but it\'s his talent and originality that have kept him at the top of the Hollywood tree. He worked on such films as The Fox and the Hound (1981) and The Black Cauldron (1985), but had some creative differences with his colleagues. Nevertheless, Disney recognized his talent, and gave him the green light to make Вiнсент (1982), an animated short about a boy who wanted to be just like Vincent Price. Narrated by Price himself, the short was a critical success and won several awards. Burton made a few other short films, including his first live-action film, Франкенвiнi (1984). A half-hour long twist on the tale of Frankenstein, it was deemed inappropriate for children and wasn\'t released. But actor Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) saw Франкенвiнi (1984), and believed that Burton would be the right man to direct him in his first full-length feature film, Велика пригода Пi-Вi (1985). The film was a surprise success, and Burton instantly became popular. However, many of the scripts that were offered to him after this were essentially just spin-offs of the film, and Burton wanted to do something new.For three years, he made no more films, until he was presented with the script for Бiтлджюс (1988). The script was wild and wasn\'t really about anything, but was filled with such artistic and quirky opportunities, Burton couldn\'t say no. Бiтлджюс (1988) was another big hit, and Burton\'s name in Hollywood was solidified. It was also his first film with actor Michael Keaton. Warner Bros. then entrusted him with Бетмен (1989), a film based on the immensely popular comic book series of the same name. Starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, the film was the most financially successful film of the year and Burton\'s biggest box-office hit to date. Due to the fantastic success of his first three films, he was given the green light to make his next film, any kind of film he wanted. That film was Едвард Руки-ножицi (1990), one of his most emotional, esteemed and artistic films to date. Едвард Руки-ножицi (1990) was also Burton\'s first film with actor Johnny Depp. Burton\'s next film was Бетмен повертаеться (1992), and was darker and quirkier than the first one, and, while by no means a financial flop, many people felt somewhat disappointed by it. While working on Бетмен повертаеться (1992), he also produced the popular Жах перед Рiздвом (1993), directed by former fellow Disney Animator Henry Selick. Burton reunited with Johnny Depp on the film Ед Вуд (1994), a film showered with critical acclaim, Martin Landau won an academy award for his performance in it, and it is very popular now, but flopped during its initial release. Burton\'s subsequent film, Марс атакуе! (1996), had much more vibrant colors than his other films. Despite being directed by Burton and featuring all-star actors including Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Pierce Brosnan and Michael J. Fox, it received mediocre reviews and wasn\'t immensely popular at the box office, either.Burton returned to his darker and more artistic form with the film Сонна лощина (1999), starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Casper Van Dien. The film was praised for its art direction and was financially successful, redeeming Burton of the disappointment many had felt by Марс атакуе! (1996). His next film was Планета Мавп (2001), a remake of the classic of the same name. The film was panned by many critics but was still financially successful. While on the set of Планета Мавп (2001), Burton met Helena Bonham Carter, with whom he has two children. Burton directed the film Велика риба (2003) - a much more conventional film than most of his others, it received a good deal of critical praise, although it disappointed some of his long-time fans who preferred the quirkiness of his other, earlier films. Despite the fluctuations in his career, Burton proved himself to be one of the most popular directors of the late 20th century. He directed Johnny Depp once again in Чарлi та шоколадна фабрика (2005), a film as quirky anything he\'s ever done.'),(811,'Anthony Michael Hall','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGZkMTI3NmEtMzg0MS00MjRkLWJkZGQtNDdhMTMxZDJjNjU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODUwMjgxNDU@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1968-04-14','Anthony Michael Hall was born in West Roxbury, Massachusetts.

His parents, Jeanne (Martyn) and Ronald Worthington, a power plant employee, moved the family to Australia when he was six months old, and raised him and his sister Lucinda in Warnbro, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia.Worthington graduated from NIDA (Australia\'s National Institute of Dramatic Art) in 1998 at the age of 22. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of \"Arthur Wellesley\" in his first professional role in the Belvoir Street Theatre production \"Judas Kiss\" (directed by Neil Armfield). He then went on to work in Australian television on such shows as Water Rats (1996) and \"Backburner\" and then on the American TV show JAG (1995)\'s 100th episode (Boomerang: Part 1).Worthington made his film debut in the highly acclaimed Australian movie Bootmen (2000), a film about a troop of \"tap dogs\". Minor roles proceeded in Вiйна Харта (2002) and A Matter of Life (2001) before he was cast in another hailed Australian drama, Dirty Deeds (2002), co-starring Toni Collette and John Goodman.The following year, he starred in yet another Aussie film, opposite David Wenham in Я зав\'язав (2003). The director of the film, Jonathan Teplitzky, originally tested actors who were up to 8 years older than the then-27-year-old Worthington. Teplitzky wasn\'t sure Sam \"could convincingly play a tough guy and also have elements of the leading man about him\", but in the end Teplitzky decided he was \"fantastic\", and had \"David playing the older, slightly more streetwise accomplice\" proclaiming \"it worked\".But it wasn\'t until 2004 that Sam got his big break. He was offered the starring role in Cate Shortland\'s acclaimed Australian drama Somersault (2004), opposite Abbie Cornish. The film made a clean sweep of the Australian Film Institute awards in 2004, winning in 13 film categories - the first time this has ever occurred in the award\'s history. Worthington also won the AFI award for Best Male Actor.Worthington\'s career took off internationally when he was cast as Jake Sully in James Cameron\'s Аватар (2009) and as Marcus Wright, a cyborg who assists the humans despite their suspicions of him in Термiнатор: Спасiння прийде (2009).

Improvisation, sketch and stand-up are his forte.Todd Joseph Miller was born in Denver, Colorado, to Leslie, a clinical psychologist, and Kent Miller, an attorney. He went to East High School, and college in Washington, D.C. There, he performed with the group receSs for 4 years, being the only person in his class out of 100 to audition and be accepted into the group. He remained the sole member of receSs until his junior year, when he was joined by Michael \"Tuck The Ruckus\" Tokaruk, an acclaimed comedian and equestrian, who taught T.J. how to ride a horse, a pastime he calls \"droll.\" He met his future wife, Kate Gorney, when they performed in \"A Chorus Line\" in university production of the musical. She played The Ballerina (being an accomplished ballerina herself) and he played Richie, the African American character. He credits the casting to East High School, which was a primarily black and Latino high school, and also that no black people auditioned for the part.During his time in the nation\'s capital, he studied classical acting at B.A.D.A in Oxford, England and circus arts at Frichess Theatre Urbain. He was outstanding in the field of stilt walking, but was never able to execute any trick, at all, on Trapeze. He is an accomplished clown and juggler, having mastered 5 ball juggling, over fifty 3-ball tricks, clubs, torches, knives, and his specialty (which garnered him a Magician Membership to The Magic Castle in Hollywood, CA) Cigar Boxes.After graduating with honors (a bachelor\'s degree in psychology with a concentration in persuasion theory and social influence) he moved to Chicago where he began performing with independent improvisation teams such as the group Chuckle Sandwich, the i.o. house team Bullet Lounge, The sketch group Heavy Weight (with Mark Raterman, Nick Vatterott & Brady Novak). He toured with Second City for almost 2 years (though he was never a company member of the MainStage), and during that time he missed over 15 flights to various cities the company toured to. During his time in Chicago, he performed standup every night for almost 4 years, never taking a night off even on holidays. He became a regular at Chicago\'s famed alternative room The Lincoln Lodge, and only performed at Chicago\'s Zanies Comedy Club 3 times in 4 years, apparently because they had an aversion to his absurdist style.Miller\'s first appearance on television was on The Standard Deviants, a PBS show aimed at providing educational DVDs and programming for schools. He played a knight and a dinosaur detective.Proficient in every medium of comedy (he considers even \'acting\' simply another medium of comedy) he is also a voiceover artist, having worked for Old Style, Mucinex, Cars.com among other brands as well as in feature films & animated television shows.In 2011 he produced a 42 track E.P. entitled \"The Extended Play E.P.\" with Comedy Central Records, a folk/pop/hip hop concept album, which he describes as satirical; aimed at celebrities that cross over into other mediums they have no business being in simply because of their brand name (he also considers himself \"a proponent of the semicolon, \"it is underused and feared for no particular reason\"). He then remixed this album with Illegal Art, a legitimate music label, enlisting the roster of artists on the label (including the godfather of sampling, \"Steinski\") the same year. According to him, this was to prove that the album, when given to actual musicians, became superior to the original, in addition to satirizing artists that remix one song and sell it to listeners multiple times.He considers his greatest performance to be his portrayal of Ranger Jones, in Yogi Bear 3D, which filmed in New Zealand and wrapped shortly before his seizure that led to the discovery of an AVM (which he alleges confirmed rather than initiated his absurdist philosophy). He has stated multiple times that it was the pinnacle of his artistic career, and that \"it\'s in some ways comforting to have reached the pinnacle of his career so early on\" and that is has been all downhill since that point.Aside from being a major proponent of Denver, his hometown, he has done extensive charity work and continues to visit East High School, where he did his first stand-up performance in drama class. He credits his teacher, Melody Duggan, for much of his success and thanked her specifically in his speech when he won a Critic\'s Choice Award for best supporting actor in a comedy series (For HBO\'s Silicon Valley).He frequently cites his compulsive and almost pathologically driven work ethic as an altruistic effort to distract people from the tragedy that permeates everyday life, and believed that comedy would be more of a contribution than psychology, since instead of affecting only at most a few hundred people dramatically, he can affect millions of people in small increments.He has publicly stated, \"Comedians are the new philosophers\" and believes that academic philosophers are no longer relevant. However, he is a student of philosophy and subscribes to the ethical philosophy of John Stuart Mill (Utilitarianism), which states that one should make the most amount happiness for the most amount of people, which he cites as one of the reasons he made the his decision to be a comedian. His stand-up (as of 2015) is aimed at \"discussing Time and the release of the death anxiety.\" By the age of 33 he had read all of Nietzsche\'s works, and considers himself an Absurdist with philosophical roots in Nihilism.He resides in Los Angeles, where he struggles to make meaning in an uncertain world.'),(825,'Jeanne Tripplehorn','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MTAxMjAyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIwNTIzNw@@._V1_UY317_CR10,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1963-06-10','Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 10, 1963, Jeanne Tripplehorn developed an interest in performing through her father, guitarist Tom Tripplehorn, who at one time recorded with the pop group Gary Lewis & The Playboys on such hits as \"This Diamond Ring\". (Note: many references list Jeanne\'s father\'s birthdate as February 2, 1949, but this seems unlikely as he would have been only 14 years old when she was born). Graduating from Edison High School, Jeanne began her career as a local radio and TV host.Educated at both the University of Tulsa and the drama division of The Juilliard School in New York City, she made her major TV debut in a supporting role in The Perfect Tribute (1991), a fictional story that centered around President Abraham Lincoln\'s Gettysburg Address. The next year she made a big splash with her second lead, in Paul Verhoeven\'s thriller Основний iнстинкт (1992), in support of Michael Douglas. In this movie, which made a sex star out of Sharon Stone, Jeanne\'s weird psychiatrist role established her as a talent to be reckoned with, although a torrid sex scene with Douglas certainly helped. She earned a huge break when she replaced a pregnant Robin Wright in the role of Tom Cruise\'s wife in the box-office smash Фiрма (1993). Her smart work in this film afforded her the opportunity to work opposite other \"top guns\" in the industry, including Kevin Costner in the futuristic Водний свiт (1995), Gwyneth Paltrow in Обережно, дверi зачиняються (1998) and Hugh Grant in Mickey Blue Eyes (1999). While none of these roles impressed to a great degree, they nevertheless put her in good standing. Reaching into her versatile bag of tricks, she went on to play everything from a lesbian gangster in Mike Figgis\' experimental film, Timecode (2000), to a love interest of left-wing activist Abbie Hoffman in Steal This Movie (2000).On stage, the lady with the strikingly open face and penetrating glare made her Broadway bow in the role of \"Masha\" in Anton Chekhov\'s \"The Three Sisters\", opposite Amy Irving and Lili Taylor. Prior to this, she appeared off-Broadway in John Patrick Shanley\'s \"The Big Funk\" in 1990, then co-starred with Val Kilmer in a 1993 production of John Ford\'s 1630s play, \"\'Tis Pity She\'s a Whore\". In 2002, Jeanne was one of a revolving door of guest stars to appear in the Actor\'s Alley play \"The Guys\", a tribute to the valiant firefighters of the 9/11 attack. On television, Jeanne appeared less frequently but did star, opposite Arliss Howard, in a superlative TV-movie adaptation of William Faulkner\'s Old Man (1997).Although the beginning of the millennium has been rather unspectacular for her career-wise, her private life has been sailing along beautifully. Back in the 1990s, she maintained a rollercoaster relationship with actor/writer Ben Stiller. Engaged at one point in 1993, she even appeared on his early \'90s TV show, The Ben Stiller Show (1992), on occasion. But the union broke up after six years, and in 2000 Jeanne married actor Leland Orser of TV\'s Швидка допомога (1994) fame. She bore Orser, who appeared with her in the movies Very Bad Things (1998) and Brother\'s Keeper (2002), a son named August Tripplehorn Orser, in 2002.

Joe and Myra were Vaudevillian comedians with a popular, ever-changing variety act, giving Keaton an eclectic and interesting upbringing. In the earliest days on stage, they traveled with a medicine show that included family friend, illusionist Harry Houdini. Keaton himself verified the origin of his nickname \"Buster\", given to him by Houdini, when at the age of three, fell down a flight of stairs and was picked up and dusted off by Houdini, who said to Keaton\'s father Joe, also nearby, that the fall was \'a buster\'. Savvy showman Joe Keaton liked the nickname, which has stuck for more than 100 years.At the age of four, Keaton had already begun acting with his parents on the stage. Their act soon gained the reputation as one of the roughest in the country, for their wild, physical antics on stage. It was normal for Joe to throw Buster around the stage, participate in elaborate, dangerous stunts to the reverie of audiences. After several years on the Vaudeville circuit, \"The Three Keatons\", toured until Keaton had to break up the act due to his father\'s increasing alcohol dependence, making him a show business veteran by the age of 21.While in New York looking for work, a chance run-in with the wildly successful film star and director Roscoe \'Fatty\' Arbuckle, resulted in Arbuckle inviting him to be in his upcoming short The Butcher Boy (1917), an appearance that launched Keaton\'s film career, and spawned a friendship that lasted until Arbuckle\'s sudden death in 1933. By 1920, after making several successful shorts together, Arbuckle moved on to features, and Keaton inherited his studio, allowing him the opportunity to begin producing his own films. By September 1921, tragedy touched Arbuckle\'s life by way of a scandal, where he was tried three times for the murder of Virginia Rapp. Although he was not guilty of the charges, and never convicted, he was unable to regain his status, and the viewing public would no longer tolerate his presence in film. Keaton stood by his friend and mentor through out the incident, supporting him financially, finding him directorial work, even risking his own budding reputation offering to testify on Arbuckle\'s behalf.In 1921, Keaton also married his first wife, Natalie Talmadge under unusual circumstance that have never been fully clarified. Popular conjecture states that he was encouraged by Joseph M. Schenck to marry into the powerful Talmadge dynasty, that he himself was already a part of. The union bore Keaton two sons. Keaton\'s independent shorts soon became too limiting for the growing star, and after a string of popular films like One Week (1920), The Boat (1921) and Cops (1922), Keaton made the transition into feature films. His first feature, Three Ages (1923), was produced similarly to his short films, and was the dawning of a new era in comedic cinema, where it became apparent to Keaton that he had to put more focus on the story lines and characterization.At the height of his popularity, he was making two features a year, and followed Ages with Our Hospitality (1923), The Navigator (1924) and Генерал (1926), the latter two he regarded as his best films. The most renowned of Keaton\'s comedies is Шерлок молодший (1924), which used cutting edge special effects that received mixed reviews as critics and audiences alike had never seen anything like it, and did not know what to make of it. Modern day film scholars liken the story and effects to Christopher Nolan Початок (2010), for its high level concept and ground-breaking execution. Keaton\'s Civil War epic The General (1926) kept up his momentum when he gave audiences the biggest and most expensive sequence ever seen in film at the time. At its climax, a bridge collapses while a train is passing over it, sending the train into a river. This wowed audiences, but did little for its long-term financial success. Audiences did not respond well to the film, disliking the higher level of drama over comedy, and the main character being a Confederate soldier.After a few more silent features, including College (1927) and Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928), Keaton was informed that his contract had been sold to MGM, by brother-in-law and producer Joseph M. Schenck. Keaton regarded the incident as the worst professional mistake he ever made, as it sent his career, legacy, and personal life into a vicious downward spiral for many years. His first film with MGM was Кiнооператор (1928), which is regarded as one of his best silent comedies, but the release signified the loss of control Keaton would incur, never again regaining his film -making independence. He made one more silent film at MGM entitled Spite Marriage (1929) before the sound era arrived.His first appearance in a film with sound was with the ensemble piece The Hollywood Revue of 1929 (1929), though despite the popularity of it and his previous MGM silents, MGM never allowed Keaton his own production unit, and increasingly reduced his creative control over his films. By 1932, his marriage to Natalie Talmadge had dissolved when she sued him for divorce, and in an effort to placate her, put up little resistance. This resulted in the loss of the home he had built for his family nicknamed \"The Italian Villa\", the bulk of his assets, and contact with his children. Natalie changed their last names from Keaton to Talmadge, and they were disallowed from speaking about their father or seeing him. About 10 years later, when they became of age, they rekindled the relationship with Keaton. His hardships in his professional and private life that had been slowly taking their toll, begun to culminate by the early 1930s resulting in his own dependence on alcohol, and sometimes violent and erratic behavior. Depressed, penniless, and out of control, he was fired by MGM by 1933, and became a full-fledged alcoholic.After spending time in hospitals to attempt and treat his alcoholism, he met second wife Mae Scrivens, a nurse, and married her hastily in Mexico, only to end in divorce by 1935. After his firing, he made several low-budget shorts for Educational Pictures, and spent the next several years of his life fading out of public favor, and finding work where he could. His career was slightly reinvigorated when he produced the short Grand Slam Opera (1936), which many of his fans admire for giving such a good performance during the most difficult and unmanageable years of his life.In 1940, he met and married his third wife Eleanor Norris, who was deeply devoted to him, and remained his constant companion and partner until Keaton\'s death. After several more years of hardship working as an uncredited, underpaid gag man for comedians such as the Marx Brothers, he was consulted on how to do a realistic and comedic fall for In the Good Old Summertime (1949) in which an expensive violin is destroyed. Finding no one who could do this better than him, he was given a minor role in the film. His presence reignited interest in his silent films, which lead to interviews, television appearances, film roles, and world tours that kept him busy for the rest of his life.After several more film, television, and stage appearances through the 1960s, he wrote the autobiography \"My Wonderful World of Slapstick\", having completed nearly 150 films in the span of his ground-breaking career. His last film appearance was A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966) which premiered seven months after Keaton\'s death from the rapid onset of lung cancer. Since his death, Keaton\'s legacy is being discovered by new generations of viewers every day, many of his films are available on YouTube, DVD and Blu-ray, where he, like all gold-gilded and beloved entertainers can live forever.'),(831,'Scott Eastwood','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ4ODU5NjIxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzNTIzNzM@._V1_UY317_CR12,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1986-03-21','Scott Eastwood was born Scott Clinton Reeves in Carmel, Monterey County, California, to Jacelyn Ann Reeves, a flight attendant, and Clint Eastwood, an actor and director.

The model-turned-actor has also serenaded Jamie Lee Curtis with Britney Spears\' \"Baby One More Time\" in Шалена п\'ятниця (2003), became Hilary Duff\'s \"Prince Charming\" in Iсторiя Попелюшки (2004), and even watched Paris Hilton die a violent on-screen death in House of Wax (2005).Chad Michael Murray was born in Buffalo, New York. Growing up, his mother left his family at a young age and he had to help take care of his younger siblings, together with his brother and his father, Rex Murray, an air traffic controller. While working his way through adolescence, he learned a lot about work ethics, which eventually helped built his character. Chad once said in an interview that he could call his father anytime of the day whenever he needs help as his father is \"his rock\".The One Tree Hill (2003) star started his life as a paper boy, delivering newspapers around the neighborhood before working as a janitor at Donut World. Chad only worked there for a few days when he lost his job because he was shooting Skittles into the deep-fryer. Sure enough, one of the Skittles got caught in the machine and Chad got fired. Chad also worked as a receptionist at a limousine company. When he was 15, he had a resection of his small intestines. His intestines were so twisted they had to be cut out, but there were some complications causing him to not be able to eat for three months. Chad also broke his nose when he was jumped at a Burger King outlet which then required him to be admitted into the hospital. It was there where he met the person who inspired him, his nurse. His nurse was a model and she told Chad to start modeling, but Chad only wanted to act.Chad then took a chance and went to a convention in Buffalo and they wanted him to go to another convention in Biloxi, Mississipi. There, he met a man named Eddie Winkler, who offered Chad a place to stay in Los Angeles to kick-start his career. Not long afterwards, Chad was hired for a Tommy Hilfiger campaign which helped paid his bills and that was when he thought he could really focus on acting. He started out on Затока Доусона (1998) with his two One Tree Hill (2003) co-stars, Hilarie Burton and Lee Norris. Two years later, he scored the role of rich brat \"Tristian DuGrey\" on Дiвчата Гiлмор (2000) before playing \"Lucas Scott\", one half of the young Scott brothers in the popular teen drama One Tree Hill (2003), where he met best friends James Lafferty and Tyler Hilton.

Murray also released \"Everlast\", his first graphic novel. \"Everlast\" is a passion project of his that tells the story of the tragic hero, \"Derek Everlast\", as he follows his journey to save the world before the \"End of Days\".Chad played football growing up and his love for the sport was projected in a charity game where he would help underprivileged kids with the money he gains from audiences. A fan of philosophy himself, Chad\'s favorite book is \"Catcher in the Rye\" by J.D. Salinger. He enjoys listening to music from Incubus, Frank Sinatra, James Brown and watching shows such as Сiмпсони (1989) and Fear Factor (2001).

After watching Бутч Кессiдi та Санденс Кiд (1969) as a child, Guy realized that what he wanted to do was make films. He never attended film school, saying that the work of film school graduates was boring and unwatchable. At 15 years old, he dropped out of school and in 1995, got a job as a runner, ultimately starting his film career. He quickly progressed and was directing music promos for bands and commercials by 1995.The profits that he made from directing these promos was invested into writing and making the film The Hard Case (1995), a 20-minute short film that is also the prequel to his debut feature Карти, грошi, два стволи (1998). Sting\'s wife, Trudie Styler, saw The Hard Case (1995) and invested in the feature film. Once completed, 10 British distributors turned the film down before it eventually was released in the UK in 1998 and in the US in 1999; the film put Ritchie on the map as one of the hottest rising filmmakers of the time, and launched the careers of actors Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng, and Vinnie Jones, among others.Карти, грошi, два стволи (1998) was followed by Великий куш (2000), this time with a bigger budget and a few more familiar faces such as Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro alongside returning actors Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Jason Flemyng. At the end of 2000, Ritchie married the pop superstar Madonna in Scotland, and proceeded to work with his famous wife on a variety of film and video projects, including the short Зiрка (2001), made for BMW and co-starring Clive Owen, and the controversial video \"What It Feels Like for a Girl,\" which was called out for its violence. In 2002, the couple embarked on a remake of the 1974 Lina Wertmüller film Вiднесенi (2002); the new film was a critical and commercial flop, winning five Razzie Awards. Ritchie followed up with the Vegas heist film Револьвер (2005), which was panned, but won favor with the crime thriller Рок-н-рольщик (2008), which featured a game, energetic cast and brought American attention to rising stars Gerard Butler and Tom Hardy.The next year saw the release of Шерлок Холмс (2009), starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role and Jude Law as his cohort Dr. Watson. The film received mostly good reviews but, more important for Ritchie\'s career, was a solid blockbuster hit that grossed more than $520 million dollars worldwide and spawned a sequel, Шерлок Холмс: Гра тiней (2011). Ritchie is tentatively scheduled to direct an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson\'s Treasure Island.Ritchie has two sons with Madonna: Rocco, born in 2000, and an adopted son, David, born in 2005. In late 2008, the couple confirmed reports that they were splitting up, and agreed to a divorce settlement that was finalized in December of that year.

His father introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, Van Damme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master Claude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme trained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He won the European professional karate association\'s middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels. In 1976 at the age of sixteen, Jean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career.Over the next 6-years, he competed in both full-contact and semi-contact matches. He debuted under his birth name of Jean Claude Van Varenberg. In his first match, Jean-Claude was staggered by a round-house kick thrown by fellow countryman, Toon Van Oostrum in Brussels, Belgium. Van Damme was badly stunned, but came back to knockout Van Oostrum moments later. In 1977, at the WAKO Open International in Antwerp, Belgium, Jean-Claude lost a decision to fellow team mate Patrick Teugels in a semi-contact match. At the 1978 Challenge De Espoirs Karate Tournament (1st Trials),Jean-Claude placed 2nd in the semi-contact division. He defeated twenty-five opponents during the week long tournament, but lost in the finals to Angelo Spataro from the Naha Club. Later in 1978, Jean-Claude lost a 3-round match for the Belgium Lightweight Championship (semi-contact) to his fellow team-mate to Patrick Teugels.In 1979, Jean-Claude traveled to the United States of America, to Tampa, Florida. In his first and only match against a United States opponent, Van Damme faced \'Sherman \'Big Train\'Bergman\', a kick-boxer from Miami Beach, Florida. For the first and only time in his career, Jean-Claude was knocked to the canvas after absorbing a powerful left hook from Bergman. However, Jean-Claude climbed off the canvas and with a perfectly timed ax-kick, knocked Bergman out in 56 seconds of the first round. Jean-Claude was a member of the Belgium team which competed on December 26, 1979 at the La Coupe Fancois Persoons Karate Tournament which was sanctioned by the Federation bruxelloise de Karate. Van Damme\'s final match victory enabled his team to win the European Team Karate Championship. In Full-Contact karate, Jean-Claude knocked out England\'s Micheal Heming in 46 seconds of the first round. In 1980, Van Damme knocked out France\'s Georges Verlugels in 2 rounds of a match fought under kick-boxing rules. Jean-Claude wanted to defeat his rival Patrick Teugels. At the Forest Nationals in Brussels, on March 8, 1980, Jean-Claude knocked Teugels down and Teugels suffered a nose injury and was unable to continue. Jean-Claude was awarded a first round victory.Jean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following a knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels,Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a 18-1 (18 knockouts) Kickboxing record, and a Semi-Contact record of 41-4. He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981 Van Damme moved to Los Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to Chuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave Van Damme a small role in the movie Missing in Action (1984), but it wasn\'t good enough to get anybody\'s attention. Then in 1984 he got a role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie No Retreat, No Surrender (1986). Then one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures, and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in Кривавий спорт (1988). But the movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if Van Damme did not help them to recut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the U.S. Shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a U.S box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about 30 million worldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational action star Jean-Claude Van Damme.His martial arts assets, highlighted by his ability to deliver a kick to an opponent\'s head during a leaping 360-degree turn, and his good looks led to starring roles in higher budgeted movies like Cyborg (1989), Lionheart (1990), Double Impact (1991) and Унiверсальний солдат (1992). In 1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit Timecop (1994). But in the meantime, his personal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage, followed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his projects began to tank at the box office - The Quest (1996), which he directed; Maximum Risk (1996) and Double Team (1997). The three films made less than $50 million combined. In 1999 he remarried his ex-wife Gladys Portugues and restarted his lost career to attain new goals. With help from his family he faced his problems and made movies like Replicant (2001), Пiд укiс (2002), and In Hell (2003) which did averagely in box office terms, but he tried to give his fans the best, his acting in those movies got better, more emotional and each movie was basically in different action tones.'),(848,'Riley Keough','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Nzc1ODkzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUwNjE5MDI@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1989-05-29','Actress and model Danielle Riley Keough was born in Santa Monica, California, to musicians Lisa Marie Presley and Danny Keough.

A quiet, passive beauty, she had a soothing quality to her open-faced looks and voice. She was a natural when he came to tearjerkers and she certainly had a knack for opening up her film-goer\'s tear ducts with her arresting performances in sentimental drama. She preferred to rest on her acting laurels than engage in publicity-monging to win roles. As a result, Dorothy was surprisingly ill-served in the awards department during her over five-decade film career, yet left a major imprint on celluloid. Touching, complex, immaculate in poise and style, she is now and forever etched in Hollywood\'s \"Golden Age\" annals and in the minds of film lovers everywhere.Dorothy began inconspicuously enough in Omaha, Nebraska on Wednesday, June 14th, 1916. Her parents encouraged her early interest in acting and she made her debut as a teenager in \"A Kiss for Cinderella\" at the Omaha Community Playhouse which starred visiting alumni member Henry Fonda. She received her education at Omaha Junior College, Ladywood Convent in Indianapolis, and Pine Manor Junior College in Wellesley, Massachusetts before setting her sites on an acting career. Following summer stock she appeared in such 1938 stage productions as \"Bachelor Born\" and \"Stopover\" before understudying the role of Emily Gibb in Thornton Wilder\'s \"Our Town\" on Broadway, which at the time showcased young Martha Scott. Dorothy eventually replaced Scott in the role.Other experiences came her way on stage with \"My Dear Children\" starring John Barrymore, \"Swingin\' the Dream\", \"Medicine Show\", \"The Time of Your Life\" and \"Kind Lady\" before she was handed the titular role of \"Claudia\" in 1941. This gentle comedy became a certifiable Broadway hit and Dorothy simply incandescent as the child-like bride forced to wake up to reality after her sudden marriage. David O. Selznick subsequently signed her to a film contract. Fortunately, 20th Century-Fox, untrue to form, took a chance on the film unknown and allowed her to recreate her stage triumph opposite Robert Young. Claudia (1943) was so beautifully done and warmly received that McGuire and Young went on to recreate their roles three years later with Claudia and David (1946).Unbelievably, Dorothy topped herself in only her second film role. After a pregnant Gene Tierney became unavailable for the role of Katie Nolan in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), the part fell to Dorothy. It\'s now hard to believe anyone else in the role. As the impoverished wife of a charming Irish ne\'er-do-well and inebriate, Dorothy showed amazing complexity as the detached wife and mother whose painful but necessary decision-making alienates many around her, especially her daughter who is the apple of her daddy\'s eye. Directed by Elia Kazan, Dorothy was shamefully overlooked at awards time. Young Peggy Ann Garner was given a \"special juvenile Oscar\" and errant husband James Dunn picked up the Supporting Actor trophy for his work. Dorothy was not of the mind of tooting her own horn and it may have cost her an Oscar nomination -- better yet, the Oscar -- for she was hands down the better performer than eventual winner Joan Crawford, a popular choice for Mildred Pierce (1945).Dorothy made it four film hits in a row with the success of both the sentimental fantasy The Enchanted Cottage (1945), in which she reunited with Robert Young to play two of society\'s castoffs who fall in love, and the expert Hitchcockian thriller The Spiral Staircase (1946) as the mute servant who is terrorized by a serial killer. Preferring rich characterizations over glamour, audiences saw Dorothy dolled up a bit more than usual in Till the End of Time (1946) as a war widow who falls for a younger hunk (Guy Madison). Her 40s filming was capped by a Best Actress nomination in Джентльменська угода (1947), an-anti-Semitic tale that boasted a topnotch ensemble cast including Gregory Peck, John Garfield and Celeste Holm, who won a supporting Oscar for this.With nary a weak film yet on her resume, an unpretentious Dorothy still hadn\'t achieved top cinematic stardom. Preferring to return to her theater roots, she abandoned films for a couple of years and performed in such vehicles as \"Tonight at 8:30\" (1947) and \"Summer and Smoke\" (1950). When she did return it was to a different Hollywood and things would not be the same. Instead forgettable fluff such as Mother Didn\'t Tell Me (1950) and Callaway Went Thataway (1951) were the slim pickings offered. Although she found a popular hit with Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), the film was more notable for its title song and sumptuous settings than for the quality of acting of the three distaff stars -- McGuire, Maggie McNamara and Jean Peters.Dorothy graciously moved into pillar-of-strength mother roles as she approached her 40s, making fine impressions as a Quaker matriarch in Friendly Persuasion (1956) and as the resourceful mom in three of Disney\'s endearing classics, Old Yeller (1957), Swiss Family Robinson (1960) and Summer Magic (1963). Her more flawed marital and parenting skills were displayed in the Inge film adaptation of The Dark at the Top of the Stairs (1960), and the huge, sudsy teen hit A Summer Place (1959) with Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue as young, star-crossed lovers. McGuire acted as Donahue\'s mother who rekindles an old love affair with Dee\'s father (Richard Egan). The 49-year-old McGuire then played the mother of all mothers, the Virgin Mary, in the misguided biblical epic The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), marred by its overlong narrative and bizarre miscasting, including John Wayne as a Roman centurion. Her last film, the British-made Flight of the Doves (1971) as an Irish granny, had little impact.In later years Dorothy found rich, rewarding work on TV and received an Emmy nomination for the well-received mini-series Rich Man, Poor Man (1976). She also played Marmee in a TV revisitation of Little Women: Episode #1.1 (1978), and ended her career in good company with (what else?) a sentimental tearjerker in the mini-movie The Last Best Year (1990) co-starring Bernadette Peters and Mary Tyler Moore.Dorothy\'s longtime husband was photographer John Swope who died in 1979. Her children by him are Mark Swope, an artist and photographer, and former actress Topo Swope. Dorothy\'s health declined severely after she fell and broke her leg in 2001. She died of heart failure not long after in a Santa Monica hospital on Friday, September 14th at the age of 85.'),(858,'Eli Roth','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMjU0NDk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDY4MDE4NTM@._V1_UY317_CR11,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1972-04-18','Eli Raphael Roth was born in Newton, Massachusetts, to Cora (Bialis), a painter, and Sheldon H.

To earn a living, Roth did budgets and schedules for the films A Price Above Rubies (1998) and Iллюмiната (1998) and often worked as a stand-in, where he could watch directors work with the actors. In 1995, Roth co-wrote the script that would eventually become Cabin Fever (2002) with friend Randy Pearlstein, and the two spent many years unsuccessfully trying to get the film financed. Roth left New York in 1999 to live in Los Angeles, and within four months got funding for his animation series Chowdaheads (1999). Roth and friend Noah Belson (Cabin Fever (2002)\'s Guitar Man) wrote and voiced the episodes, which Roth produced, directed and designed. The episodes were due to run on W.C.W.\'s #1 rated series WCW Monday Nitro (1995) but the C.E.O. was fired a day before they were scheduled to air, and the episodes never ran. Roth used the episodes to set up a stop motion series called The Rotten Fruit (2003) which he produced, directed and animated, as well as co-wrote and voiced with friend Belson. Between the two animated series, Roth worked closely with director David Lynch, producing content for the website davidlynch.com.In 2001, Roth filmed Cabin Fever (2002) on a shoestring budget of $1.5 million, with private equity he and his producers raised from friends and family. The film was the subject of a bidding war at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, eventually won by Lion\'s Gate, instantly doubling their investors\' money. It went on to not only be the highest grossing film for Lion\'s Gate in 2003, but the most profitable horror film released that year, garnering critical acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Empire Magazine, and such filmmakers as Peter Jackson, Quentin Tarantino and Tobe Hooper. Roth used the film\'s success to launch a slew of projects, including Посилка (2009), a horror thriller he co-wrote with Richard Kelly. In May of 2003, Roth joined forces with filmmakers Boaz Yakin, Scott Spiegel, and Greenestreet Films in New York to form Raw Nerve, LLC, a horror film production company.In 2014, Eli married Chilean model and actress Lorenza Izzo.'),(859,'Melora Hardin','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNzAzODk5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjEyNTE2Mg@@._V1_UY317_CR5,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1967-06-29','Melora Hardin was born on June 29, 1967 in Houston, Texas, USA as Melora Diane Hardin.

For it was fourteen years after her movie debut that Gina made movie history as the predatory bisexual who was the leading light of a Las Vegas leg-line in director Paul Verhoeven\'s kitsch classic Шоугьолз (1995). Exploding out of a plaster-of-Paris volcano clad in nothing but body makeup and a G-string, Gina Gershon obtained cinema immortality. After Шоугьолз (1995), she solidified her reputation, playing a lesbian sexpot in the Wachovski Bros\' neo-noir Зв\'язок (1996).Gina Gershon was born in the Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills, the last in a brood of three kids. Her mother, Mickey (Koppel), worked as an interior decorator, and her father, Stanley Gershon, was a salesman and worked in the import/export business. Her paternal grandparents were from Russian Jewish families, and her maternal grandparents were born in Holland and Belgium, both of them to Jewish families from Poland. Gina was raised in the San Fernando Valley, and got the acting bug early, appearing at the age of seven in a school production of Bye Bye Birdie (1963). Because of her acting ambitions, her parents moved to Beverly Hills so Gina could attend Beverly Hills High, where she indulged her acting jones by appearing in a student production of The Music Man (1962). Her first love, she says, is singing.After graduating from high school in 1980, she attended Emerson College in Boston, but took a part in the musical \"Runaways\". She transferred to New York University, where her official biography says she studied philosophy and psychology, but she graduated from the Tisch School of the Arts, taking a bachelor of fine arts degree in drama in 1983. In New York City, while perfecting her craft, she co-founded the theater company Naked Angels with Helen Slater.Her big-screen breakthrough came with a part in the 1986 \"Brat Pack\" teenage hit Pretty in Pink (1986). She also had parts in the Tom Cruise vehicle Cocktail (1988) and Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s Червона спека (1988). Of this period, she says, \"One of my first gigs, a movie called Cocktail (1988), I found myself at 8 in the morning, in bed, practically naked, having to make out with Tom Cruise; hmmmm... movie business - so far, so good\".Citing Frank Sinatra\'s song \"My Way\" as an inspiration, she says that following Cocktail (1988), \"I was fortunate enough to play many diversified roles in film, television and stage. Not always to the liking of my managers and agents, but I always did what I wanted....\" She played Nancy Sinatra, Frank\'s first wife, in the TV miniseries Sinatra (1992).Gina Gershon became a celebrity in Шоугьолз (1995). The following year, Gershon solidified her claim on second-tier stardom playing the calculating lesbian \"Corky\" in the crime movie Bound (1995). She never did capitalize on her mid-1990s breakthrough, but Gershon is established as a character actress and is never out of work, unlike most of her female peers who started out in the industry at the same time. Though no classic beauty, the talented thespian remains gainfully employed while many actresses of her vintage are out of work as she is possessed of a unique look and smoldering sex appeal that comes across on camera.Gershon is versatile, too, as at home on stage as she is in front of the camera. After appearing in off-Broadway and regional theater productions, she made her Broadway debut as a replacement in Sam Mendes\' revival of Кабаре (1972) in January 2001. For six months, she played the key role of \"Sally Bowles\", returning that October to reprise the role for another month. In 2008, she once again appeared on Broadway in the revival of the farce \"Boeing Boeing\" on Broadway, which won the Tony award for Best Revival.Gina Gershon also is a children\'s book writer. In 2008, Putmam Juvenile published her \"Camp Creepy Time\", a tale of a boy who discovers aliens at his summer camp, which she co-wrote with her brother, Dann Gershon. \"Camp Creepy Time\" recently was optioned by DreamWorks, which plans to turn it into a movie. In 2008, she also released \"In Search Of Cleo\", a CD featuring nine songs which she wrote or co-wrote.'),(861,'Holliday Grainger','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMDQ3OTY5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODU3ODM4OA@@._V1_UY317_CR7,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1988-03-27','Holliday Grainger was born on March 27, 1988 in Didsbury, Manchester, England as Holliday Clark Grainger.

Cotillard is the daughter of Jean-Claude Cotillard, an actor, playwright and director, and Niseema Theillaud, an actress and drama teacher. Her father\'s family is Breton.Raised in Orléans, France, she made her acting debut as a child with a role in one of her father\'s plays. She studied drama at the Conservatoire d\'Art Dramatique in Orléans. After small appearances and performances in theater, Cotillard had occasional and minor roles in TV series such as Горець (1992) and Extrême limite (1994), but her career as a film actress began in the mid-1990s. While still a teenager, Cotillard made her cinema debut at the age of 18 in the film L\'histoire du garçon qui voulait qu\'on l\'embrasse (1994), and had small but noticeable roles in films such as Arnaud Desplechin\'s Comment je me suis disputé... (ma vie sexuelle) (1996) and Coline Serreau\'s comedy La belle verte (1996).In 1996, she had her first lead role in the TV film Chloé (1996), playing the title role - a teenage runaway who is forced into prostitution. Cotillard co-starred opposite Anna Karina, the muse of the Nouvelle Vague.In 1997, she won her first film award at the Festival Rencontres Cinématographiques d\'Istres in France, for her performance as the young imprisoned Nathalie in the short film Affaire classée (1997). Her first prominent screen role was Lilly Bertineau in Gérard Pirès\'s box-office hit Таксi (1998), a role which she reprised in two sequels: Таксi 2 (2000) and Таксi 3 (2003), this role earned her first César award nomination (France\'s equivalent to the Oscar) for Most Promising Actress in 1999.In 1999, Cotillard starred as Julie Bonzon in the Swiss war drama La guerre dans le Haut Pays (1998). For her performance in the film, she won the Best Actress award at the Autrans Film Festival in France. In 2001, Marion starred in Les jolies choses (2001) as the twin sisters Marie and Lucie, and was nominated for her second César award for Most Promising Actress.Cotillard\'s breakthrough in France came in 2003, when she starred in Yann Samuell\'s dark romantic comedy Дитячi iгри (2003), in which she played Sophie Kowalsky, the daughter of Polish immigrants who lives a love-hate relationship with her childhood friend. The film was a box-office hit in France, became a cult film abroad and led Cotillard to bigger projects.Her first Hollywood movie was Tim Burton\'s Велика риба (2003), in which she played Joséphine, the wife of William Bloom (played by Billy Crudup). A few years later, Marion starred in Ridley Scott\'s Хороший рiк (2006) playing Fanny Chenal, a French café owner who falls in love with Russell Crowe\'s character. In 2004, she won the Chopard Thophy of Female Revelation at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2005, Cotillard won the César award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance of Tina Lombardi in Jean-Pierre Jeunet\'s Довгi заручини (2004).In 2007, Cotillard received international recognition for her iconic portrayal of Édith Piaf in Життя в рожевому кольорi (2007). Director Olivier Dahan cast Cotillard to play the legendary French singer because to him, her eyes were like those of \"Piaf\". The fact that she can sing also helped Cotillard land the role of \"Piaf\", although most of the singing in the film is that of Piaf\'s. The role won Cotillard the Academy Award for Best Actress along with a César, a Lumière Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe. That made her only the second actress to win an acting Oscar performing in a language other than English next to Sophia Loren (La ciociara (1960)). Only two male performers (Roberto Benigni for Життя прекрасне (1997) and Robert De Niro for Хрещений батько - 2 (1974)) have won an Oscar for solely non-English parts. Trevor Nunn called her portrayal of \"Piaf\" \"one of the greatest performances on film ever\". At the Berlin International Film Festival, where the film premiered, Cotillard was given a 15-minute standing ovation. When she won the César, Alain Delon presented the award and announced the winner as \"La Môme Marion\" (The Kid Marion), he also praised her at the stage saying: \"Marion, I give you this César. I think this César is for a great great actress, and I know what I\'m talking about\".Cotillard has worked much more frequently in English-language movies following her Academy Award recognition. In 2009, she acted opposite Johnny Depp in Michael Mann\'s Джоннi Д. (2009), and later that year played Luisa Contini in Rob Marshall\'s musical Дев\'ять (2009) and received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Time magazine ranked her as the fifth best performance by a female in 2009. The following year, she took on the main antagonist role, Mal, in Christopher Nolan\'s Початок (2010), and in 2011 she had memorable parts in Опiвночi в Парижi (2011) and Зараза (2011) and reteamed with Christopher Nolan in Темний лицар повертаеться (2012).In 2011 and 2012 respectively, Cotillard appeared on the top of Le Figaro\'s list of the highest paid actors in France, it was the first time in nine years that a female topped the list.

He was one of the first of the \"video store\" generation of film-makers. His father was the first man on his block to own a V.C.R., and from a very early age Anderson had an infinite number of titles available to him. While film-makers like Spielberg cut their teeth making 8 mm films, Anderson cut his teeth shooting films on video and editing them from V.C.R. to V.C.R.Part of Anderson\'s artistic D.N.A. comes from his father, who hosted a late night horror show in Cleveland. His father knew a number of oddball celebrities such as Robert Ridgely, an actor who often appeared in Mel Brooks\' films and would later play \"The Colonel\" in Anderson\'s Ночi в стилi бугi (1997). Anderson was also very much shaped by growing up in \"The Valley\", specifically the suburban San Fernando Valley of greater Los Angeles. The Valley may have been immortalized in the 1980s for its mall-hopping \"Valley Girls\", but for Anderson it was a slightly seedy part of suburban America. You were close to Hollywood, yet you weren\'t there. Would-bes and burn-outs populated the area. Anderson\'s experiences growing up in \"The Valley\" have no doubt shaped his artistic self, especially since three of his four theatrical features are set in the Valley.Anderson got into film-making at a young age. His most significant amateur film was The Dirk Diggler Story (1988), a sort of mock-documentary a la This Is Spinal Tap (1984), about a once-great pornography star named Dirk Diggler. After enrolling in N.Y.U.\'s film program for two days, Anderson got his tuition back and made his own short film, Cigarettes & Coffee (1993). He also worked as a production assistant on numerous commercials and music videos before he got the chance to make his first feature, something he liked to call Sydney (1996), but would later become known to the public as \"Hard Eight\". The film was developed and financed through The Sundance Lab, not unlike Quentin Tarantino\'s Скаженi пси (1992). Anderson cast three actors whom he would continue working with in the future: Altman veteran Philip Baker Hall, the husky and lovable John C. Reilly and, in a small part, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who so far has been featured in all four of Anderson\'s films. The film deals with a guardian angel type (played by Hall) who takes down-on-his-luck Reilly under his wing. The deliberately paced film featured a number of Anderson trademarks: wonderful use of source light, long takes and top-notch acting. Yet the film was reedited (and retitled) by Rysher Entertainment against Anderson\'s wishes. It was admired by critics, but didn\'t catch on at the box office. Still, it was enough for Anderson to eventually get his next movie financed. \"Boogie Nights\" was, in a sense, a remake of \"The Dirk Diggler Story\", but Anderson threw away the satirical approach and instead painted a broad canvas about a makeshift family of pornographers. The film was often joyous in its look at the 1970s and the days when pornography was still shot on film, still shown in theatres, and its actors could at least delude themselves into believing that they were movie stars. Yet \"Boogie Nights\" did not flinch at the dark side, showing a murder and suicide, literally in one (almost) uninterrupted shot, and also showing the lives of these people deteriorate, while also showing how their lives recovered.Anderson not only worked with Hall, Reilly and Hoffman again, he also worked with Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, William H. Macy and Luis Guzmán. Collectively, Anderson had something that was rare in U.S. cinema: a stock company of top-notch actors. Aside from the above mentioned, Anderson also drew terrific performances from Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg, two actors whose careers were not exactly going full-blast at the time of \"Boogie Nights\", but who found themselves to be that much more employable afterwards.The success of \"Boogie Nights\" gave Anderson the chance to really go for broke in Магнолiя (1999), a massive mosaic that could dwarf Altman\'s Нешвiлл (1975) in its number of characters.Anderson was awarded a \"Best Director\" award at Cannes for Кохання, що збиваe з нiг (2002).'),(865,'Julia Garner','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU3NDRjMDEtNTQ2Ni00ZGZmLTk3ZjUtODUxMjA2NGY4NDg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMDM0NDU@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1994-02-01','Julia Garner is an American actress and model.

He began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s before obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the early 1990s that culminated in his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the neo-noir crime thriller The Usual Suspects (1995), and an Academy Award for Best Actor for midlife crisis-themed drama American Beauty (1999).His other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film Swimming with Sharks (1994), psychological thriller Seven (1995), the neo-noir crime film L.A. Confidential (1997), the drama Pay It Forward (2000), the science fiction-mystery film K-PAX (2001)In Broadway theatre, Spacey won a Tony Award for his role in Lost in Yonkers. He was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. Since 2013, Spacey has played Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series House of Cards. His work in House of Cards earned him Golden Globe Award and Emmy Award nominations for Best Actor.As enigmatic as he is talented, Kevin Spacey for years kept the details of his private life closely guarded. As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard, \"the less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person\". In October 2017, he ended many years of media speculation about his personal life by confirming that he had enjoyed sexual relations with both men and women but now identified as homosexual.There are, however, certain biographical facts to be had - for starters, Kevin Spacey Fowler was the youngest of three children born to Kathleen Ann (Knutson) and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, in South Orange, New Jersey. His ancestry includes Swedish (from his maternal grandfather) and English. His mother was a personal secretary, his father a technical writer whose irregular job prospects led the family all over the country. The family eventually settled in southern California, where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister\'s tree house on fire, he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy, only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire. Spacey then found his way to Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, where he managed to channel his dramatic tendencies into a successful amateur acting career. In his senior year, he played \"Captain von Trapp\" opposite classmate Mare Winningham\'s \"Maria\" in \"The Sound of Music\" (the pair later graduated as co-valedictorians). Spacey claims that his interest in acting - and his nearly encyclopedic accumulation of film knowledge - began at an early age, when he would sneak downstairs to watch the late late show on TV. Later, in high school, he and his friends cut class to catch revival films at the NuArt Theater. The adolescent Spacey worked up celebrity impersonations (James Stewart and Johnny Carson were two of his favorites) to try out on the amateur comedy club circuit.He briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, then left (on the advice of another Chatsworth classmate, Val Kilmer) to join the drama program at Juilliard. After two years of training he was anxious to work, so he quit Juilliard sans diploma and signed up with the New York Shakespeare Festival. His first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in the 1981 production of \"Henry VI\".Festival head Joseph Papp ushered the young actor out into the \"real world\" of theater, and the next year Spacey made his Broadway debut in Henrik Ibsen\'s \"Ghosts\". He quickly proved himself as an energetic and versatile performer (at one point, he rotated through all the parts in David Rabe\'s \"Hurlyburly\"). In 1986, he had the chance to work with his idol and future mentor, Jack Lemmon, on a production of Eugene O\'Neill\'s \"Long Day\'s Journey Into Night\". While his interest soon turned to film, Spacey would remain active in the theater community - in 1991, he won a Tony Award for his turn as \"Uncle Louie\" in Neil Simon\'s Broadway hit \"Lost in Yonkers\" and, in 1999, he returned to the boards for a revival of O\'Neill\'s \"The Iceman Cometh\".Spacey\'s film career began modestly, with a small part as a subway thief in Heartburn (1986). Deemed more of a \"character actor\" than a \"leading man\", he stayed on the periphery in his next few films, but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain \"Mel Profitt\" on the TV series Wiseguy (1987). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark, manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in Гленгаррi Глен Росс (1992), a sadistic Hollywood exec in Swimming with Sharks (1994), and, most famously, creepy, smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in Пiдозрiлi особи (1995).The \"Suspects\" role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year, he turned in another complex, eerie performance in David Fincher\'s thriller Сiм (1995) (Spacey refused billing on the film, fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now, the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in Al Pacino\'s Looking for Richard (1996), Spacey made his own directorial debut with Albino Alligator (1996), a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting, winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in Секрети Лос-Анджелеса (1997) and genteel, closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997). In October 1999, just four days after the dark suburban comedy Краса по-американськи (1999) opened in US theaters, Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown, he tapped into a funny, savage character that captured audiences\' imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar.No longer relegated to offbeat supporting parts, Spacey seems poised to redefine himself as a Hollywood headliner. He says he\'s finished exploring the dark side - but, given his attraction to complex characters, that mischievous twinkle will never be too far from his eyes.In February 2003 Spacey made a major move back to the theatre. He was appointed Artistic Director of the new company set up to save the famous Old Vic theatre, The Old Vic Theatre Company. Although he did not undertake to stop appearing in movies altogether, he undertook to remain in this leading post for ten years, and to act in as well as to direct plays during that time. His first production, of which he was the director, was the September 2004 British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos (made into a film, Cloaca (2003)). Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut in the title role in Richard II in 2005. In 2006 he got movie director Robert Altman to direct for the stage the little-known Arthur Miller play Resurrection Blues, but that was a dismal failure. However Spacey remained optimistic, and insisted that a few mistakes are part of the learning process. He starred thereafter with great success in Eugene O\'Neill\'s A Moon for the Misbegotten along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best, and in 2007 that show transferred to Broadway. In February 2008 Spacey put on a revival of the David Mamet 1988 play Speed-the-Plow in which he took one of the three roles, the others being taken by Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly.In 2013, Spacey took on the lead role in an original Netflix series, Картковий будинок (2013). Based upon a British show of the same name, House of Cards is an American political drama. The show\'s first season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination to include Outstanding lead actor in a drama series. In 2017, he played a memorable role as a villain in the action thriller На драйвi (2017).'),(871,'Madison Iseman','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzNjZmQ3ZjEtNjVkYS00YmRlLTk4OTktZGI1N2NiMzcxODNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDIxNzMxNTc@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1997-02-14','Madison Iseman (born February 14, 1997) is an American actress.

As Mr. Wednesday, a shifty, silver-tongued conman, he masks his true identity - that of the Norse god of war, Odin, who\'s assembling a team of elders to bring down the new false idols. A series McShane calls \"like nothing else I\'ve seen on television.\"It\'s a comment that also befits McShane\'s critically-acclaimed role of the charismatic, menacing and lawless 19th century brothel-and-bar keep, Al Swearengen, in the profound and profane HBO western series \"Deadwood,\" which ran for just 36 episodes over three seasons from 2004-06. For his work on the series\' second season, McShane won the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Drama (in addition to Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nominations as Outstanding Lead Dramatic Actor). He also received the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama for his work in the show\'s debut season (with a second nomination in 2005).It is a role and performance the New York Times dubbed \"one of the most interesting villains on television.\" And, a recent online poll called Swearengen a more compelling onscreen gangster over the likes of Tony Soprano and Michael Corleone. After a twelve-year hiatus from portraying maybe his most iconic character (\"it was the most satisfyingly creative three years of my professional career\" he says), McShane recently reprised the unforgettable rogue when HBO resurrected the 1870s western in a two-hour telefilm, \"Deadwood: The Movie,\" nominated for the Outstanding Television Movie Emmy.At an age when many successful thespians turn to cameo appearances and character parts, McShane\'s busy career (which dates back to 1962) also includes three very different starring roles on the big screen in the coming months. He was seen alongside David Harbour in Neil Marshall\'s reimagined comic book epic, \"Hellboy.\" McShane also co-starred with Gary Carr in the Dan Pritzker drama, \"Bolden,\" the biopic of musician Buddy Bolden, the father of jazz and a key figure in the development of ragtime music (McShane portrays Bolden\'s nemesis, Judge Perry). And, he reprised his role (reuniting with Keanu Reeves) as Winston, the suave and charming owner of the assassins-only Tribeca hotel in the latest installment of director Chad Stahelski\'s action trilogy, \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,\" which opened to enormous box office success.Years before his triumphant role in \"Deadwood,\" McShane had compiled a long and diverse career on both British and American television. He produced and starred in the acclaimed series \"Lovejoy\" for the BBC (and A&E in the U.S.), directing several episodes during the show\'s lengthy run. The popular Sunday night drama (which attracted 18 million viewers weekly during its run from 1990-94) saw McShane in the title role of an irresistible, roguish Suffolk antiques dealer. He would reunite with the BBC by producing and starring in the darker and more serious drama, Madson.He collected a second Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Miniseries for his portrayal of the scheming Waleran Bigod in Starz\'s Emmy-nominated \"Pillars of the Earth.\" The production, which originated on the U.K.\'s Channel 4, was based on Ken Follett\'s bestselling historic novel about the building of a 12th-century cathedral during the time known as \"the Anarchy\" after King Henry I had lost his only son in the White Ship disaster of 1120. It\'s a character McShane says \"would fit into the Vatican.\"He is also well-known to TV audiences for his roles in FX\'s \"American Horror Story,\" Showtime\'s \"Ray Donovan\" and, more recently, Amazon\'s \"Dr. Thorne\" and HBO\'s juggernaut, \"Game of Thrones\" (\"I loved the character and did it because my three grandkids, big fans of the show, wouldn\'t have forgiven me if I hadn\'t\"). And, he first worked with \"American Gods\" producer Michael Green on the short-lived NBC drama, \"Kings,\" a show (inspired by The Book Of Samuel) he calls \"far too revolutionary for network television.\"Other notable small screen roles include his appearance in David Wolper\'s landmark miniseries \"Roots\" (as the British cockfighting aficionado), \"Whose Life Is it Anyway?,\" Heathcliff in the 1967 miniseries \"Wuthering Heights\" and Harold Pinter\'s Emmy-winning \"The Caretaker.\" McShane has also played a variety of real-life subjects like Sejanus in the miniseries \"A.D.,\" the title role of Masterpiece Theater\'s \"Disraeli: Portrait of A Romantic\" and Judas in NBC\'s \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (directed by Franco Zeffirelli).McShane, who shows no signs of slowing down in a career now entrenched in its sixth decade (\"acting is the only business where the older you get, the parts and the pay get better\"), began his career during Britain\'s New Wave Cinema of the early 1960s. He landed his first lead role in the 1962 English feature \"The Wild and the Willing,\" which also starred another acting upstart and fellow Brit - McShane\'s lifelong friend, the late John Hurt. McShane later revealed that he had ditched class at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to audition for the role.Since that 1962 motion picture debut, McShane has enjoyed a fabulous run of character roles such as the sinister Cockney mobster, Teddy Bass, opposite Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast\"; the infamous pirate, Blackbeard, alongside Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\"; and Richard Burton\'s bi-sexual partner, Wolfie, in the 1971 heist film, \"Villain.\" He gave Hayley Mills her first onscreen kiss as a smoldering gypsy in 1965\'s \"Sky West and Crooked,\" was part of the stellar ensemble cast (James Mason, James Coburn, Dyan Cannon) in the Stephen Sondheim-Anthony Perkins scripted big screen mystery, \"The Last of Sheila,\" and played a retired sheriff with a violent past opposite Patrick Wilson in the gritty drama, \"The Hollow Point.\"Other film credits include Guy Hamilton\'s all-star WWII epic, \"The Battle of Britain,\" the romantic comedy \"If It\'s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium,\" \"Pottersville,\" \"Hercules,\" \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" and \"Jawbone\" (reuniting with fellow Brit Ray Winstone in both), \"Jack the Giant Slayer,\" Woody Allen\'s \"Scoop,\" Rodrigo Garcia\'s indie drama \"Nine Lives\" (Gotham Award nominee for Best Ensemble Performance) and the darkly perverse crime drama, \"44 Inch Chest,\" a film in which McShane not only starred, but also produced.While also making his professional theatre debut in 1962 (\"Infanticide in the House of Fred August,\" Arts Theatre, London), McShane appeared onstage in the original 1965 production of Joe Orton\'s \"Loot.\" Two years later, he starred alongside Ian McKellen and Judi Dench in the hit stage play, \"The Promise,\" a production which transferred to Broadway in 1967 (with Eileen Atkins replacing Dench). He would return to Broadway one more time forty years later (2008), starring in the 40th anniversary staging of Harold Pinter\'s \"The Homecoming,\" for which he shared a Drama Desk Award as Best Cast Ensemble.McShane also returned to the West End boards in 2000, charming audiences as the seductive, sex-obsessed Darryl Van Horne while making his musical stage debut in Cameron Mackintosh\'s \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" an adaptation of the 1987 film. At the esteemed Matrix Theatre in Los Angeles, he appeared in Harold Pinter\'s \"Betrayal,\" and John Osborne\'s \"Inadmissible Evidence,\" earning a pair of Los Angeles Drama Critics\' Awards for Lead Performance in the process. He also starred in the world premiere of Larry Atlas\' \"Yield of the Long Bond.\"In addition to his work in front of the camera, McShane is also well-known for his voiceover work, with his low, distinctive baritone on display in a variety of projects. He voiced the eccentric magician, Mr. Bobinsky, in Henry Selick\'s award nominated \"Coraline\" (scripted by \"American Gods\" author Neil Gaiman), lent a sinister air to Tai Lung, the snow leopard adept at martial arts, in \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Annie Award nominee), and created the notorious Captain Hook in \"Shrek the Third.\" He also narrated Grace Jones\' 1985 album, Slave to the Rhythm, succumbing to producer Trevor Horn\'s request to take the job because, per Horn,\" Orson Welles was dead, and I needed a voice.\" The album sold over a million copies worldwide. In the virtual reality domain, he recently lent his voice to the award- winning VR animated short \"Age of Sail\" in the role of the elderly sailor, William Avery, adrift alone in the North Atlantic.After almost sixty years entertaining audiences across the performance spectrum, McShane admits he did not set out for a career in the footlights while growing up in Manchester, England (he was actually born in Blackburn). It was by unexpected circumstances after McShane broke his leg playing soccer that he ended up performing in the school play production of Cyrano De Bergerac where he met his life-long friend and teacher, Leslie Ryder. Before he knew it, he auditioned for the Royal Academy of Arts where he was accepted and then left a term early to appear in the film, \"The Wild and The Willing\".McShane never looked back.'),(874,'Mary-Louise Parker','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE1MTc4ODQ5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM4NTEzMQ@@._V1_UY317_CR4,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1964-08-02','Southern-bred Mary-Louise Parker was born on August 2, 1964 in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, the youngest of four children of Judge John Morgan Parker, and the former Caroline Louise Morell. She is of mostly Swedish, English, and Scottish descent. Her father\'s occupation took the family both around the country and abroad while growing up.Parker showed potential in her teens and majored in acting in her college years, graduating from the North Carolina School of the Arts. Beginning her acting career with a part on the daytime soap Ryan\'s Hope (1975), Mary decided to test the waters in New York, and after work on the off-Broadway stage in the late 1980s, made her Broadway debut with \"Prelude to a Kiss\" in 1990, where she won the Theatre World Award, the Clarence Derwent Award and a Tony nomination. Films and TV quickly followed and she quickly gained attention. She provided both poignant and amusing as the token femme friend to a group of gay men in the AIDS drama Longtime Companion (1989), but really caught fire with her feisty, standout performance in Смаженi зеленi помiдори (1991), holding her own against such female powerhouses as Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates and Mary Stuart Masterson. Dubbed by some as the \"long-suffering girl next door\", she played such noble offbeat miserables and cast-asides in Grand Canyon (1991), Naked in New York (1993), Bullets Over Broadway (1994), The Client (1994) Boys on the Side (1995), in which she was the AIDS victim this time, The Portrait of a Lady (1996), The Maker (1997), Let the Devil Wear Black (1999), Червоний дракон (2002) and Pipe Dream (2002). Preferring quality over quantity, she perfected her craft with offbeat roles in independent features and did not abandon her theater roots. She copped a slew of acting prizes for her stage work in \"How I Learned to Drive\" (1996) and, most notably, \"Proof\" in 2000, wherein she won nearly every award there is to attain, including the prestigious Tony. Her marquee name still does not command what it should, but a picture or production with Mary-Louise Parker in it usually guarantees a strong critical reception. Unmarried, she did enter into a longtime companionship with actor Billy Crudup after the twosome appeared opposite each other in the 1996 play, \"Bus Stop\". They went their separate ways in 2003, amid major controversy (she was pregnant at the time).Mary Louise continues to divide her time equally and skillfully on TV, film and the stage. The powerful TV miniseries adaptation of Tony Kushner heralded award-winning Broadway play Angels in America (2003), directed by Mike Nichols, earned the actress supporting performance Golden Globe and Emmy awards. She also earned a Tony nomination for the Broadway show, \"Reckless\", a year later but truly turned heads and wowed audiences the year after that in the highly acclaimed 7-season Showtime series Косяки (2005), earning another Golden Globe and several Emmy nominations for her amazing performance as Nancy Botwin, a relatively naïve suburban housewife and mother who courts serious trouble with the law and drug cartels when she turns into a neighborhood drug dealer for sustenance after her husband dies suddenly. Since then she has appeared in РЕД 2 (2013), R.I.P.D.

She grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. Her father, a sculptor and mechanic, left the family when Rene was just two, and thus her mother raised Rene and her sister, Toni, as a single mom. Her father was of Italian descent, and her mother was of Italian and German-English-Irish ancestry.In junior high school, Rene was plagued with scoliosis and had to wear a full-torso brace. She was already a tall girl, which earned her the nickname \"Jolly Green Giant\" from her classmates. She entered Burroughs High School, along with classmate Ron Howard, and even though her brace had been removed, she was still somewhat of a loner. Unable to deal with academics and the school social scene, Rene dropped out of school in the tenth grade. Since money was tight, she began to take a variety of part-time jobs over the next 18 months, many for the free benefits. She sold refreshments at a movie theater, where she could see free movies; worked as a restaurant hostess, where her meals were free; and worked as a store cashier at Disneyland, where she had free admission. She often had two jobs at one time. Her last job, which was solely for the paycheck, was a full-time job at an eyeglass factory, inspecting contact lenses.In 1972, the 17-year-old was attending a Rolling Stones concert when she was approached by John Crosby, a scout and manager from International Creative Management. He told her she should be a model and had test photos made of her. Within a few months, Rene signed a contract with Ford Modeling Agency and within a year had become a successful print and photographers model. Soon her modeling breakthrough came when she graced the cover of Vogue. By 1975, she had appeared on numerous magazine covers, was one of the most successful models in America, and was also starting to be seen in several TV commercials through the 1980s. She would define what a top fashion model was for years to come.By her 30th birthday, demand for her began to dwindle, as it did for most models at that age. She did a few more commercials and then turned her back on modeling and show business for a while. Financially secure for the next several years, she began an intense period of literature and Christian theology. She also began to study theater and acting, and began appearing in theater roles at small regional theaters in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California.Her television series debut came in 1987 with a supporting part on the short-lived TV series Sable (1987). In 1989 she made her motion picture debut with the part of the lead characters girlfriend in the film Major League (1989). Her subsequent roles were that of girlfriends and supportive wives in a few films, until her breakthrough as an Internal Affairs detective in Смертельна зброя 3 (1992). Rene Russo has been praised for her ability to hold her own against her major male co-stars, who have included Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner and Pierce Brosnan. Two of her performances within the last few years have gotten her recognition as both a major dramatic actress and a talented character actress. One was as the mother of a kidnapped son in Викуп (1996). The other was as the cartoon femme fatale foreign spy in Пригоди Роккi та Бульвiнкля (2000). Although the latter received mixed reviews among moviegoers and critics, Russo was praised for her performance of a role originally slated for Meryl Streep in 1992.

Her father, David Cassidy, was a pop star in the 1970s. Her mother, Sherry Williams, was a high fashion model in the early 1970s. Sherry left her career to concentrate on raising her 3 daughters, with husband, Richard Benedon M.D., Katie\'s stepdad. Her famous relatives include uncles Shaun Cassidy, Patrick Cassidy and Ryan Cassidy, the sons by her grandfather Jack Cassidy\'s marriage to Shirley Jones; Katie\'s grandmother was Evelyn Ward. As a child, Katie took gymnastics, studied piano, guitar and singing, then took dancing and acting lessons and eventually became a cheerleader for the California Flyers. She attended Calabasas High School in her neighborhood, where she also cheered as a freshman. Her mother insisted that she complete college prep classes in high school before she embarked on her acting career. For years prior to graduation in 2005, Katie was modeling and studying acting in community theater. Katie had just been accepted to \'Tisch\' at NYU when she was offered her first role as \"Dee Dee\", which was one month before graduating. Katie has not stopped working since. Katie\'s early exposure to show business, the cosmopolitan culture of Los Angeles, her family upbringing, and her comprehensive education altogether produced a remarkable result. She grew up as a multifaceted person showing her many talents in a variety of professions such as recording her father\'s 1970s hit \"I Think I Love You\" and singing in VH1\'s TV special Bubblegum Babylon (2002), writing her own songs, modeling for Abercrombie and Fitch and Guess?\'s Rock and Republic clothing lines in 2004, and acting. However, she was publicly criticized by her father who would have liked for her to wait before she covered his classic hit. During her stint with Artemis Records, she was introduced to the popular boy band Dream Street. There she met Greg Raposo, who wrote the song \"We\'re In Love\" for her when they dated in 2002. She also met her ex-boyfriend, Jesse McCartney, there and later appeared as his love interest in his video hit \"She\'s No You\". A story on Jesse and Katie appeared in the January 2006 issue of Teen People magazine. At that time she was busy working on five feature film productions going on almost simultaneously. Katie made several appearances in TV series, such as 7th Heaven (1996) and Sex, Love & Secrets (2005), among others. She appeared as Samantha, the grown-up daughter of Adam Sandler and Kate Beckinsale in the comedy Клiк: З пультом по життю (2006).

She has lived most of her life in New York and Los Angeles; in L.A., she attended Reseda High School and Celluloid Actor\'s Studio. Her father was African-American and her mother was Ashkenazi Jewish (from a family from Poland and Russia). Her parents divorced when she was young. She began acting in commercials at the age of 11. At age 16, she landed the role of Denise Huxtable in the hit comedy series The Cosby Show (1984). The show made her a popular actress. In the mid \'80s, she met Lenny Kravitz at a New Edition concert in Los Angeles. At the time, Lenny was a struggling, unknown musician who went by the name Romeo Blue. It wasn\'t long after they started dating that Lisa and Lenny\'s relationship was all over the tabloids. The two lovers were said to be soulmates, as they shared a neo-hippie persona and biracial background (Lenny is also half-black, half-Jewish). In 1987, Lisa and Lenny got married (they went to Las Vegas and eloped), and they had a daughter named Zoë in 1988. By 1989, Lenny had landed a record deal and recorded his first album, \"Let Love Rule.\" Lisa co-wrote a couple of songs on the album and was said to have been the inspiration for most of the album. Lisa even directed Lenny\'s first video for \"Let Love Rule.\" But Lisa and Lenny\'s relationship was full of problems from the start, including intense scrutiny from the media and Lenny\'s reported infidelities. It was around this time that Lisa made a deliberate attempt to shed her \"goody-two-shoes\" Cosby daughter image by making the controversial movie Серце Ангела (1987), in which she had racy nude and sex scenes. The backlash from making Серце Ангела (1987) is rumored to have prompted Lisa\'s exit from The Cosby Show (1984). But with Bill Cosby\'s help, Lisa landed in another comedy series, A Different World (1987), in which she starred as a student at a historically black university. But perhaps because of her personal problems, Lisa began showing up late for work (or sometimes not at all), and she was fired from the series. She and Lenny separated in a bitter breakup and eventually divorced in 1993. Lenny\'s second album, \"Mama Said,\" filled with songs about heartache, is said to be mostly about Lisa. After her divorce from Lenny, Lisa faded from the high-profile stardom she had experienced when she was in a relationship with him, while Lenny became more famous than his ex-wife. No longer an in-demand actress, Lisa occasionally made B movies, many of which went straight to video. In 1992, Lisa started dating yoga instructor Bryan Kest. They began living together and it was around that time that Lisa legally changed her name to Lilakoi Moon, although she still uses the name Lisa Bonet for her entertainment career. Lisa has said that she has deliberately cut back on acting so that she could spend more time with her family. However, she did make a brief return to the spotlight in 1998 by co-starring with Will Smith in the big-budget hit movie Ворог держави (1998), and had an important role in High Fidelity (2000). Lisa has since become friends with her ex-husband Lenny again. And, in an \"aren\'t we all just one big happy family\" situation, her best friend is Cree Summer, a former co-star on A Different World (1987) who released an album produced by her long-time friend Lenny Kravitz. It was Lisa who suggested that Lenny produce the album, and Lisa directed a promotional video for the album. As of 2007, Lisa lives in the Los Angeles area with her children.'),(905,'Mischa Barton','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyNzYyMTA1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE4NjgyMQ@@._V1_UY317_CR4,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1986-01-24','Born in London and raised in New York.

He attended Crescent College, a Jesuit school, and was an excellent rugby player, with a strong passion for literature. Unfortunately, a bout of tuberculosis as a teenager ended his aspirations to a rugby career, but he became fascinated with the theater and skipped a local dance one night to attend a performance of \"Henry IV\". He was hooked and went on to learn his craft at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), then spent several years in stage productions. He debuted on screen in Shake Hands with the Devil (1959) and quickly scored regular work in films, including The Wreck of the Mary Deare (1959), A Terrible Beauty (1960) and a good role as a frustrated Australian bomber pilot in Гармати острова Наварон (1961).However, his breakthrough performance was as the quintessential \"angry young man\" in the sensational drama This Sporting Life (1963), which scored him an Oscar nomination. He then appeared in the WW II commando tale The Heroes of Telemark (1965) and in the Sam Peckinpah-directed western Major Dundee (1965). He next showed up in Hawaii (1966) and played King Arthur in Camelot (1967), a lackluster adaptation of the famous Broadway play. Better performances followed, among them a role as a reluctant police informer in The Molly Maguires (1970) alongside Sir Sean Connery. Harris took the lead role in the violent western A Man Called Horse (1970), which became something of a cult film and spawned two sequels. As the 1970s progressed, Harris continued to appear regularly on screen; however, the quality of the scripts varied from above average to woeful.His credits during this period included directing himself as an aging soccer player in Bloomfield (1970); the western The Deadly Trackers (1973); the big-budget \"disaster\" film Juggernaut (1974); the strangely-titled crime film 99 and 44/100% Dead! (1974); with Connery again in Робiн та Мерiен (1976); Gulliver\'s Travels (1977); a part in the Щелепи (1975); Orca (1977) and a nice turn as an ill-fated mercenary with Richard Burton and Roger Moore in the popular action film The Wild Geese (1978).The 1980s kicked off with Harris appearing in the silly Bo Derek vanity production Tarzan the Ape Man (1981) and the remainder of the decade had him appearing in some very forgettable productions. However, the luck of the Irish was once again to shine on Harris\'s career and he scored rave reviews (and another Oscar nomination) for The Field (1990). He then locked horns with Harrison Ford as an IRA sympathizer in Patriot Games (1992) and got one of his best roles as gunfighter English Bob in the Clint Eastwood western Непрощенний (1992). Harris was firmly back in vogue and rewarded his fans with more wonderful performances in Wrestling Ernest Hemingway (1993); Cry, the Beloved Country (1995); The Great Kandinsky (1995) and This Is the Sea (1997). Further fortune came his way with a strong performance in the blockbuster Гладiатор (2000) and he became known to an entirely new generation of film fans as Albus Dumbledore in the mega-successful Гаррi Поттер i фiлософський камiнь (2001) and Гаррi Поттер i таeмна кiмната (2002).

And though many of the actors in the studio were working actors, Mitte was using acting as a means to build friendship with kids his own age while living in a new city. At the encouragement of Witt and talent agent Debra Manners of the Daniel Hoff Agency, Mitte began auditioning for commercials and TV shows like Анатомiя Грей (2005).

A favorite of film buffs, Del Toro gained mainstream public attention as the conflicted but basically honest Mexican policeman in Steven Soderbergh\'s Трафiк (2000).Benicio was born on February 19, 1967 in San Germán, Puerto Rico, the son of lawyer parents Fausta Genoveva Sanchez Rivera and Gustavo Adolfo Del Toro Bermudez. His mother died when he was young, and his father moved the family to a farm in Pennsylvania. A basketball player with an interest in acting, he decided to follow the family way and study business at the University of California in San Diego. A class in acting resulted in his being bitten by the acting bug, and he subsequently dropped out and began studying with legendary acting teacher Stella Adler in Los Angeles and at the Circle in the Square Acting School in New York City. Telling his parents that he was taking courses in business, Del Toro hid his new studies from his family for a little while.During the late 1980s, he made several television appearances, most notably in an episode of Полiцiя Маямi (1984) and in the NBC miniseries Drug Wars: The Camarena Story (1990). Del Toro\'s big-screen career got off to a slower start, however--his first role was Duke the Dog-Faced Boy in Big Top Pee-wee (1988). However, things looked better when he landed the role of Dario, the vicious henchman in the James Bond film 007: Лiцензiя на вбивство (1989). Surprising his co-stars at age 21, Del Toro was the youngest actor ever to portray a Bond villain. However, the potential break was spoiled as the picture turned out to be one of the most disappointing Bond films ever; this was lost amid bigger summer competition.Benicio gave creditable performances in many overlooked films for the next several years, such as The Indian Runner (1991), Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992) and Money for Nothing (1993). His roles in Fearless (1993) and China Moon (1994) gained him more critical notices, and 1995 proved to be the first \"Year of Benicio\" as he gave a memorable performance in Swimming with Sharks (1994) before taking critics and film buffs by storm as the mumbling, mysterious gangster in Пiдозрiлi особи (1995), directed by Bryan Singer. Del Toro won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role in the Oscar-winning film.Staying true to his independent roots, he next gave a charismatic turn as cold-blooded gangster Gaspare Spoglia in The Funeral (1996) directed by Abel Ferrara. He also appeared as Benny Dalmau in Basquiat (1996), directed by artist friend Julian Schnabel. That year also marked his first truly commercial film, as he played cocky Spanish baseball star Juan Primo in The Fan (1996), which starred Robert De Niro. Del Toro took his first leading man role in Excess Baggage (1997), starring and produced by Alicia Silverstone. Hand-picked by Silverstone, Del Toro\'s performance was pretty much the only thing critics praised about the film, and showed the level of consciousness he was beginning to have in the minds of film fans.He took a leading role with his good friend Johnny Depp in Страх i огида в Лас-Вегасi (1998), co-written and directed by the legendary Terry Gilliam. Gaining 40 pounds for the role of Dr. Gonzo, the drug-addicted lawyer to sportswriter Raoul Duke, Benicio immersed himself totally in the role. Using his method acting training so far as to burn himself with cigarettes for a scene, this was a trying time for Del Toro. The harsh critical reviews proved tough on him, as he felt he had given his all for the role and been dismissed. Many saw the crazed, psychotic performance as a confirmation of the rumors and overall weirdness that people seemed to place on Del Toro.Taking a short break after the ordeal, 2000 proved to be the second \"Year of Benicio\". He first appeared in The Way of the Gun (2000), directed by friend and writer Christopher McQuarrie. Then he went to work for actor\'s director Steven Soderbergh in Трафiк (2000). A complex and graphic film, this nonetheless became a widespread success and Oscar winner. His role as conflicted Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez functions as the movie\'s real heart amid an all-star ensemble cast, and many praised this as the year\'s best performance, a sentiment validated by a Screen Actor\'s Guild Award for \"Best Actor\". He also gave a notable performance in Великий куш (2000) directed by Guy Ritchie, which was released several weeks later, and Обiцянка (2001) directed by Sean Penn. Possessing sleepy good looks reminiscent of James Dean or Marlon Brando, Del Toro has often jokingly been referred to as the \"Spanish Brad Pitt\".With his newfound celebrity, Del Toro has become a sort of heartthrob, being voted one of People magazine\'s \"50 Most Beautiful People\" as well as \"Most Eligible Bachelors.\" A favorite of film fans for years for his diverse and \"cool guy\" gangster roles, he has become a mainstream favorite, respected for his acting skills and choices. So far very careful in his projects and who he works with, Del Toro can boast an impressive resume of films alongside some of the most influential and talented people in the film business.'),(910,'Patrick J.

Paul grew up active in sports like soccer and surfing. He had English and German ancestry.Paul was cast for the first season of the family sitcom, Throb (1986) and began modeling until he received a script for the 1994 movie, Tammy and the T-Rex (1994). He attended high school at Village Christian High School in Sun Valley, California, graduating in 1991. With encouragement from friends and an old casting agent who remembered him as a child, he decided to try his luck again with acting shortly after returning from College.He starred in Meet the Deedles (1998), a campy, silly but surprisingly fun film which failed to garner much attention. However, lack of attention would not be a problem for Paul Walker for long. With Плезентвiль (1998), he appeared in his first hit. As the town stud (a la 1950s) who more than meets his match in modern day Reese Witherspoon, he was one of the most memorable characters of the film.

The Dallas Morning News commented in March of 2000 that, \"Paul is one of the rarest birds in Hollywood- a pretension free movie star.\" The latest blockbuster hit, Форсаж (2001), had raised his stardom to an even higher level.His fighting scenes in movies lead to a passion for martial arts. He has studied various forms of Jujitsu, Taekwondo, Jeet Kune Do and Eskrima. Paul mentioned in a magazine interview that he had hoped enroll in the Keysi Fighting Method when it comes to the United States. Other than practicing martial arts, Paul enjoyed relaxing at home with his daughter, Meadow Rain, surfing near his Huntington Beach abode, walking his dogs and just driving.When Paul seriously did get a break from the entertainment business, he said he loved traveling.

His parents, Bryna (Sanglel) and Herschel Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mahilyow Voblast (now in Belarus). Although growing up in a poor ghetto, Douglas was a fine student and a keen athlete and wrestled competitively during his time at St. Lawrence University. However, he soon identified an acting scholarship as a way out of his meager existence, and was sufficiently talented to gain entry into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He only appeared in a handful of minor Broadway productions before joining the United States Navy in 1941, and then after the end of hostilities in 1945, returned to the theater and some radio work. On the insistence of ex-classmate Lauren Bacall, movie producer Hal B. Wallis screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946). His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama I Walk Alone (1947), the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend Burt Lancaster. Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), the John Frankenheimer political thriller Seven Days in May (1964) and their final pairing in the gangster comedy Tough Guys (1986). Douglas once said about his good friend: \"I\'ve finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I\'ve got nice-looking girls in my films now.\".After appearing in \"I Walk Alone\", Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping Champion (1949). The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and as tortured painter Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956), both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1955, Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director Stanley Kubrick\'s brilliant anti-war epic Шляхи слави (1957). Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent Спартак (1960). The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas\' insistence, Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives.Douglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in Lonely Are the Brave (1962), acted alongside John Wayne in the World War II story In Harm\'s Way (1965), again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, Cast a Giant Shadow (1966), and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western The War Wagon (1967). Additionally in 1963, he starred in an onstage production of Ken Kesey\'s \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest\", but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk\'s talented son Michael Douglas finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring Jack Nicholson. Into the 1970s, Douglas wasn\'t as busy as previous years; however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the loopy western comedy Лиходiй (1979), then with Farrah Fawcett in the sci-fi thriller Saturn 3 (1980) and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama The Man from Snowy River (1982).Unknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1981), and with the Jefferson Award (1983). Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute\'s Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002).

He is the son of Doris J. (Yingling) and Dr. James R. Frakes, a professor. His parents moved with Jonathan and his younger brother Daniel to Bethlehem in eastern Pennsylvania. There, his father taught English at Lehigh University, where he held the Fairchild chair in American Literature until his passing in 2002. Frakes is of German, and some English, ancestry.While growing up Jonathan was introduced to jazz by his father and started playing the trombone when he was in fourth grade. As a child Jonathan was always friendly, funny and somewhat of an actor according to a childhood friend. In high school he played in the band and ran track. He graduated from Liberty High in Bethlehem in 1970. The day after he graduated he started classes at Pennsylvania State University, enrolling as a psychology major. The next summer he worked as an usher for the local theater and observed his peers thoroughly enjoying acting. He was motivated to switch his major to theater arts and graduated with a bachelor\'s degree in 1974. He then moved to Boston to attain his masters degree from Harvard University by 1976.At this point he decided to move to New York City and try to make it as an actor. The roles did not come easily so he had to take side jobs, such as a waiter, a furniture mover (where he injured up his back), and a stint as Captain America for Marvel Comics. Meanwhile he won roles in the Broadway musical \"Shenandoah\" and on the soap opera The Doctors (1969) as Vietnam veteran Tom Carroll from 1977 to 1978. At his agent\'s urging Jonathan moved to Los Angeles in late 1978 to try his hand at television guest appearances. He guest-starred on several of the big prime-time shows of the time, including Charlie\'s Angels (1976), Fantasy Island (1977), Barnaby Jones (1973), Quincy M.E. (1976), Highway to Heaven (1984), The Waltons (1971), and The Dukes of Hazzard (1979).During the 1980s Jonathan landed a starring role in a prime-time soap opera, Bare Essence (1983), which had spun off a successful miniseries of the same name. However the show did not take off with the viewers and was soon canceled. He went back to guest appearances for two more years until he got the part of Stanley Hazard in the Civil War epic North and South (1985). After spending more than six months filming all over the southern United States, he and his co-star, Genie Francis, fell in love (he had met her three years before when they co-starred in Bare Essence (1983)). During that time he and Genie didn\'t have much to do with each other, other than his making fun of her hair, according to her. However three years later they were an item.In early 1987 Jonathan went to an audition for a new television series at the urging of his soon-to-be wife and her family. After six weeks, and seven auditions, he won the role that would bring him worldwide fame: that of Commander William Riker on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987). It was at this time, he and Genie announced their engagement. They would have to postpone their wedding twice because of his job but were finally married in the first-season hiatus on May 28, 1988. All of his new co-stars attended the wedding, along with Star Trek (1966) creator Gene Roddenberry. During the seven years Frakes starred on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), he not only acted but discovered that he had a talent for directing. He helmed eight episodes in all and was invited to direct on the Next Generation spin-offs, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and Star Trek: Voyager (1995).The day after his 42nd birthday, on August 20, his son, Jameson Ivor Frakes, was born. Jameson is named after both his grandfathers, the late James Frakes and the late actor Ivor Francis, Genie\'s father. During this time Jonathan actually turned down work, preferring to stay at home and raise his son with his wife. For the next two years he did a few guest appearances on television.In 1996 it was announced that he was to be the director of the next Star Trek film, Зоряний шлях: Перший контакт (1996). He received critical praise for his work on the film and it became the highest-grossing entry of the franchise to date. He formed a production company, Goepp Circle Productions, named after the street he lived on in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Just two days after his ninth wedding anniversary in 1997, Elizabeth Francis Frakes was born. Sadly just two weeks prior Jonathan\'s brother, Daniel, passed away from pancreatic cancer. In 1998 he was asked to direct the ninth Star Trek film, Зоряний шлях: Повстання (1998). Following mixed reviews for this film he continued to direct in movies and television, act in a few non-Star Trek roles, and starred in the tenth Star Trek film, Зоряний шлях: Вiдплата (2002).'),(952,'Wil Wheaton','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1Mjc5OTc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM1MTA4Mg@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1972-07-29','Wil Wheaton was born Richard William Wheaton III on July 29, 1972 in Burbank, California.

The New York-born actress (born in 1946) is the daughter of a night club singer, Margot Warren (née Verblow), and a real estate agent, William Warren. Her mother gave up her own entertainment career for marriage and family. Lesley attended New York\'s Professional Children\'s School and eventually studied under Lee Strasberg at his Actors Studio, the youngest student to be accepted at the time (age 17). The freckled, talented hopeful gathered musical stage experience in such shows as \"Bye Bye Birdie\" playing swooning teen Kim McAfee. She made her illustrious Broadway debut in \"110 in the Shade\", the 1963 musical version of \"The Rainmaker,\" and won the \"Most Promising Newcomer\" Award. She subsequently received the Theatre World Award for her work in the 1965 tunefest \"Drat! The Cat!\" The attention she received immediately led to her capturing the beguiling title role in the Rodgers and Hammerstein TV musical production of Попелюшка (1965). Although sweet-voiced stardom was certainly hers on a silver platter, she didn\'t necessarily carry the sweet tooth for it. Her impact as Cinderella led to her signing with the Walt Disney Studio as their principal ingénue. Co-starring in the rather blah musical showcases The Happiest Millionaire (1967) and The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968) further convinced her that she needed to nip the saccharine stereotype in the bud if she was to grow as an actress and sustain some type of career longevity. Rebelling against her studio-imposed image, she left Disney determined to pursue roles with more depth, drama and character. Changing her name temporarily to \"Lesley Warren\" to reinforce her goal, she replaced Barbara Bain in the long-running espionage series Mission: Impossible (1966) in 1970, but the audiences were quite cool in their reception to the \"new and improved\" Lesley and didn\'t buy her as a femme-fatale replacement for the cool and aloof Ms. Bain. After only one season, she left the show and sought greener pastures in the TV mini-movie market playing a wide range of vulnerable neurotics as well as sexy, worldly ladies. She made her mark in such sudsy 1970s material as Love Hate Love (1971) co-starring Ryan O\'Neal; The Legend of Valentino (1975); the rags-to-riches story Harold Robbins\' 79 Park Avenue (1977), for which she won a Golden Globe award; the epic WWII story Pearl (1978); Betrayal (1978); and Portrait of a Stripper (1979). In the early 1980s, Lesley\'s movie career resurrected itself with a priceless performance as kingpin James Garner\'s whiny-voiced, peroxide-blonde spitfire Norma Cassady in the musical film slapstick Вiктор Вiкторiя (1982). The role won her nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe, as well as winning a New York Film Critics Award and a People\'s Choice Award. This scene-stealing turn led to a couple of other quality offbeat films: Choose Me (1984) and Songwriter (1984), along with the usual quota of TV projects. Warren received nominations for a Golden Globe for Songwriter, and a People\'s Choice Award for Choose Me. She also matured into a steamy, sexier \"older woman\" type and earned some worldly roles opposite various gorgeous young guns, including Christopher Atkins in the critically-drubbed A Night in Heaven (1983). Her riotous \"dumb blonde\" act had Hollywood discovering her potential as a scatter-brained comedienne, an image she has reinforced over the years with recurring TV guest parts on such popular shows as Will & Grace (1998) and Вiдчайдушнi домогосподарки (2004). Warren\'s television credits also include a Golden Globe Award performance for Best Actress in the miniseries 79 Park Avenue. She also was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy for her role in the CBS miniseries Family of Spies. Warren received a Cable Ace nomination for her work in Tennessee Williams\' 27 Wagons Full of Cotton. She also received Cable Ace and Golden Globe nominations for her work in HBO Pictures\' Baja Oklahoma. Further television credits include leading roles in the NBC telefilm Evergreen, and the Emmy winning TNT miniseries Joseph (opposite Ben Kingsley). Warren appeared on five seasons of the USA Network drama In Plain Sight, as well as the 100th episode of Psych, a tribute to the movie Clue. Warren recently appeared in three films: Babysitter, The Sphere and the Labyrinth, and Michael co-starring James Franco and Zachary Quinto. From Cinderella to sexy mamas, the effervescent Lesley is still going strong in a career now hitting four-and-a-half decades. Lesley has a son, Christopher Peters, from her 1967-1973 union to makeup artist/hair stylist-cum-film producer Jon Peters. She was later involved romantically with Robert Evans, Jeffrey Hornaday, Val Kilmer, Paul Stanley and Scott Baio. Since 2000, she has been married to advertising exec Ron Taft, a former v.p. at Columbia and sometime actor.'),(954,'Lady Gaga','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjQwMzU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk5NjQ4NjE@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1986-03-28','Lady Gaga, born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, is an American songwriter, singer, actress, philanthropist, dancer and fashion designer.Gaga was born on March 28, 1986 in Manhattan, New York City, to Cynthia Louise (Bissett), a philanthropist and business executive, and Joseph Anthony Germanotta, Jr., an internet entrepreneur. Her father is of Italian descent; and her mother, who is from West Virginia, is of half Italian and half French-Canadian, English, German, and Scottish ancestry. Gaga was able to sing and play the piano from a young age. She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart from age 11 where was bullied for her appearance (she was small and plumper than other girls with large front teeth) and eccentric habits.By the age of 14, Gaga was performing at open mike nights in clubs and bars. By age 17, she had gained early admission to New York University\'s Tisch School of the Arts. In addition to sharpening her songwriting skills, she composed essays and analytical papers on art, religion, social issues and politics. At the age of 19 Gaga withdrew from her studies and moved out of her parents\' home in order to pursue a musical career. During this time she started a band which began to gain local attention.After a brief partnership with talent scout Rob Fusari, which resulted in the creation of her stage name, Gaga was signed to Def Jam Records in 2006; however she was dropped from the label after just three months. Devastated, Gaga returned home, and became increasingly experimental: fascinating herself with emerging neo-burlesque shows, go-go dancing at bars dressed in little more than a bikini in addition to experimenting with drugs.Gaga met performance artist Lady Starlight during this time; after a performance at Lollapalooza Festival in 2007 Gaga was signed by Vince Herbert to Streamline Records, an imprint of Interscope Records. Having served as an apprentice songwriter under an internship at Famous Music Publishing, which was later acquired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Gaga subsequently struck a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV. As a result, she was hired to write songs for Britney Spears and labelmates New Kids on the Block, Fergie, and the Pussycat Dolls. At Interscope, singer-songwriter Akon recognized her vocal abilities when she sang a reference vocal for one of his tracks in studio; Akon then convinced Interscope-Geffen-A&M Chairman and CEO Jimmy Iovine to form a joint deal by having her also sign with his own label Kon Live, making her his \"franchise player.\"In 2008 Gaga released her first album \'The Fame\' to lukewarm radio play; Gaga toured around Europe and in gay clubs in the US to promote the album - however it was not until her first hit \'Just Dance\' came to mainstream attention in 2009 that Gaga exploded onto the music scene.Since then Gaga has gained numerous awards and nominations for a string of hits; her first album spawned several more smash hits \'Paparazzi\', \'Loveame\' and \'Poker Face\'); while touring the album Gaga wrote \'The Fame Monster\', an EP examining the darker side to her new-found fame. The Fame Monster was released in 2009 and won multiple awards, spawning her most iconic single \'Bad Romance\' as well as \'Telephone\' and \'Alejandro\'. During this time Gaga came under increased public and critical scrutiny for her eccentric and often bizarre style choices. Gaga embarked on her second tour, The Monster Ball; upon finishing in May 2011, the critically acclaimed and commercially accomplished tour ran for over one and a half years and grossed $227.4 million, making it one of the highest-grossing concert tours of all time and the highest-grossing for a debut headlining artist. Concerts performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for an HBO television special. The special accrued one of its five Emmy Award nominations and has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray.In 2011 Gaga released her second full-length album \'Born this Way\'; the album was received vastly more critically than her previous two for touching on themes of politics, sexuality, and religion. Despite this, the album\'s songs were praised critically, and Born This Way sold 1.108 million copies in its first week in the US, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and topping the charts in more than 20 other countries. In addition to exceeding 8 million copies in worldwide sales, Born This Way received 3 Grammy Award nominations, including her third consecutive for Album of the Year. In March 2012, Gaga was ranked fourth on Billboard\'s list of top moneymakers of 2011, grossing $25,353,039 dollars, which included sales from Born This Way and her Monster Ball Tour.At the end of April 2012, Gaga\'s Born This Way kicked off in Korea - the tour would last 2 years and take the singer to every continent of the globe. However in February 2012 the tour was abruptly canceled; Gaga had a labral tear in her right hip which she had been nursing secretly for several weeks in the hopes that she would be able to continue the tour. After a performance in Toronto left her unable to walk and in considerable pain, she was taken to hospital for surgery and the tour was canceled. Through to Jan. 17, the tour had grossed $168.2 million and moved 1.6 million tickets to 85 shows, according to Billboard Boxscore, with the Asian, European, and South American legs already completed in 2012. The North American leg, which was to wrap the tour and was almost completely sold out, would have likely put the tour at more than $200 million gross, easily in the top 20 tours of all time and probably in the top 15, according to Billboard. As it stands, Gaga finished sixth among all touring artists in 2012, with a gross of $125 million and attendance of more than 1.1 million, according to Boxscore.Gaga wrote her third album, ARTPOP, released in 2013. Gaga made her acting debut in Robert Rodriguez\'s Мачете вбивае (2013), the sequel to his 2010 film Machete, and also appeared in Rodriguez\'s sequel Мiсто грiхiв 2: Жiнка, заради якоii варто вбивати (2014).

Over 25 years after his untimely death from mesothelioma in 1980, Steve McQueen is still considered hip and cool, and he endures as an icon of popular culture.McQueen was born in Beech Grove, Indiana, to Julia Ann (Crawford) and William Terence McQueen, a stunt pilot. His first lead role was in the low-budget sci-fi film The Blob (1958), quickly followed by roles in The St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959) and Never So Few (1959). The young McQueen appeared as Vin, alongside Yul Brynner, in the star-laden Чудова сiмка (1960) and effectively hijacked the lead from the bigger star by ensuring he was nearly always doing something in every shot he and Brynner were in together, such as adjusting his hat or gun belt. He next scored with audiences with two interesting performances, first in the World War II drama Hell Is for Heroes (1962) and then in The War Lover (1962). Riding a wave of popularity, McQueen delivered another crowd pleaser as Hilts, the Cooler King, in the knockout World War II P.O.W. film Велика втеча (1963), featuring his famous leap over the barbed wire on a motorcycle while being pursued by Nazi troops (in fact, however, the stunt was actually performed by his good friend, stunt rider Bud Ekins).McQueen next appeared in several films of mixed quality, including Soldier in the Rain (1963); Love with the Proper Stranger (1963) and Baby the Rain Must Fall (1965). However, they failed to really grab audience attention, but his role as Eric Stoner in The Cincinnati Kid (1965), alongside screen legend Edward G. Robinson and Karl Malden, had movie fans filling theaters again to see the ice-cool McQueen they loved. He was back in another Western, Nevada Smith (1966), again with Malden, and then he gave what many consider to be his finest dramatic performance as loner US Navy sailor Jake Holman in the superb The Sand Pebbles (1966). McQueen was genuine hot property and next appeared with Faye Dunaway in the provocative crime drama The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), next in what many consider his signature role, that of a maverick, taciturn detective in the mega-hit Детектив Булiт (1968), renowned for its famous chase sequence through San Francisco between McQueen\'s Ford Mustang and the killer\'s black Dodge Charger.Interestingly, McQueen\'s next role was a total departure from the action genre, as he played Southerner Boon Hogganbeck in the family-oriented The Reivers (1969), based on the popular William Faulkner novel. Not surprisingly, the film didn\'t go over particularly well with audiences, even though it was an entertaining and well made production, and McQueen showed an interesting comedic side of his acting talents. He returned to more familiar territory, with the race film Le Mans (1971), a rather self-indulgent exercise, and its slow plot line contributed to its rather poor performance in theaters. It was not until many years later that it became something of a cult film, primarily because of the footage of Porsche 917s roaring around race tracks in France. McQueen then teamed up with maverick Hollywood director Sam Peckinpah to star in the modern Western Junior Bonner (1972), about a family of rodeo riders, and again with Peckinpah as bank robber Doc McCoy in the violent The Getaway (1972). Both did good business at the box office. McQueen\'s next role was a refreshing surprise and Метелик (1973), based on the Henri Charrière novel of the same name, was well received by fans and critics alike. He plays a convict on a French penal colony in South America who persists in trying to escape from his captors and feels their wrath when his attempts fail.The 1970s is a decade remembered for a slew of \"disaster\" movies and McQueen starred in arguably the biggest of the time, Пекло у пiднебессi (1974). He shared equal top billing with Paul Newman and an impressive line-up of co-stars including Fred Astaire, Robert Vaughn and Faye Dunaway. McQueen does not appear until roughly halfway into the film as San Francisco fire chief Mike O\'Halloran, battling to extinguish an inferno in a 138-story skyscraper. The film was a monster hit and set the benchmark for other disaster movies that followed. However, it was McQueen\'s last film role for several years. After a four-year hiatus he surprised fans, and was almost unrecognizable under long hair and a beard, as a rabble-rousing early environmentalist in An Enemy of the People (1978), based on the Henrik Ibsen play.McQueen\'s last two film performances were in the unusual Western Tom Horn (1980), then he portrayed real-life bounty hunter Ralph \"Papa\' Thorson (Ralph Thorson) in The Hunter (1980). In 1978, McQueen developed a small but persistent cough that would not go away. He quit smoking and underwent antibiotic treatments without improvement. Shortness of breath grew more pronounced and on December 22, 1979, after he completed work on \'The Hunter\', a biopsy revealed pleural mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure for which there is no known cure. The asbestos was thought to have been in the protective suits worn in his race car driving days, but in fact the auto racing suits McQueen wore were made of Nomex, a DuPont fire-resistant aramid fiber that contains no asbestos. McQueen later gave a medical interview in which he believed that asbestos used in movie sound stage insulation and race-drivers\' protective suits and helmets could have been involved, but he thought it more likely that his illness was a direct result of massive exposure while removing asbestos lagging from pipes aboard a troop ship while in the US Marines.By February 1980, there was evidence of widespread metastasis. While he tried to keep the condition a secret, the National Enquirer disclosed that he had \"terminal cancer\" on March 11, 1980. In July, McQueen traveled to Rosarito Beach, Mexico for an unconventional treatment after American doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life. Controversy arose over McQueen\'s Mexican trip, because McQueen sought a non-traditional cancer treatment called the Gerson Therapy that used coffee enemas, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cows and sheep, massage and laetrile, a supposedly \"natural\" anti-cancer drug available in Mexico, but not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. McQueen paid for these unconventional medical treatments by himself in cash payments which was said to have cost an upwards of $40,000 per month during his three-month stay in Mexico. McQueen was treated by William Donald Kelley, whose only medical license had been (until revoked in 1976) for orthodontics.McQueen returned to the United States in early October 1980. Despite metastasis of the cancer through McQueen\'s body, Kelley publicly announced that McQueen would be completely cured and return to normal life. McQueen\'s condition soon worsened and \"huge\" tumors developed in his abdomen. In late October, McQueen flew to Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico to have an abdominal tumor on his liver (weighing around five pounds) removed, despite warnings from his American doctors that the tumor was inoperable and his heart could not withstand the surgery. McQueen checked into a Juarez clinic under the alias \"Sam Shepard\" where the local Mexican doctors and staff at the small, low-income clinic were unaware of his actual identity.Steve McQueen passed away on November 7, 1980, at age 50 after the cancer surgery which was said to be successful. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea. He married three times and had a lifelong love of motor racing, once remarking, \"Racing is life. Anything before or after is just waiting.\".'),(959,'Ryan Paevey','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzNiOTBlYWQtMTk4My00MWNmLTkzYzktOTA1NjE2OTk4ZWIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_UY317_CR104,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1984-09-24','Ryan started modeling in high school and has, with a few breaks, been shooting ever since.

His father, a distinguished Professor of Animal Sciences & Industry at Kansas State University, and his mother, a nutritionist, divorced when he was nine years old. James grew up with his four other siblings, sisters, Jennifer and Elizabeth, and brothers, Jeff and Robert. He has English, German, and Scottish ancestry. During his teen years, he attended Putnam City North High School which was located in Oklahoma City. After graduating in 1991, he attended Oklahoma State University and studied Broadcast Journalism. While in university, he became a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.While vacationing with his family in Hawaii, he met actor Kirk Cameron, and his actress sister, Candace Cameron Bure. They eventually invited James to visit them in Los Angeles. After studying in Oklahoma State for over a year and appearing in his college production, \"Bye Bye Birdie\", he left school and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his interest in acting. James got his first job on the pilot episode of The Nanny (1993) as Eddie, who was Margaret Sheffield\'s boyfriend. He then became part of the Canadian television series, Boogies Diner (1994), which aired for one season. After that series ended, he got a brief role as the original Griffin on Fox\'s Party of Five (1994). His first big break came when he became the lead on the short-lived ABC series, Second Noah (1996). Although the show didn\'t last long, the young actor received enough exposure from the public and even managed to win the hearts of fellow teenage girls. In 1996, he attended an audition for a movie titled Первiсний страх (1996) but unfortunately lost that role to Edward Norton. Two years later, he was offered a lead role in 54 (1998), which he turned down. The role later went to another actor, Ryan Phillippe.James\' star power increased when he starred in David Nutter\'s Disturbing Behavior (1998), alongside Katie Holmes and Nick Stahl, which had mixed reviews, but mostly positive ones. His role in the television series as Glenn Foy in Ally McBeal (1997), is probably one of his biggest achievement to date. He became one of the main cast members during the first half of season 5, where he showcased his singing abilities. It was in that show where he was able to grab the attention of audiences from different backgrounds. The 5\' 10\" star later played Lon Hammon Jr. in the romantic movie, Щоденник пам\'ятi (2004), which was based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks of the same name. His movies, The Alibi (2006) and 10th & Wolf (2006) was also released around the world to audiences in the year 2006. One of his most memorable roles to fans is his role as Cyclops in the Люди Iкс (2000) movie franchise. The movie was well accepted by audiences and critics, which eventually made James one of the hottest stars since it was released. He was among the actors who starred in all three of the X-Men movies. James had the honor of working alongside Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen and Hugh Jackman in the film. However, not many people know that he actually had to wear lifts for most of his scenes in the X-men movies, because his character Cyclops is supposed to be 6\" 3\" compared to a 5\' 3\" Wolverine. In reality, he is actually under 6\' 0\", shorter than Famke Janssen who plays his love interest, Jean Grey, and even shorter than Hugh Jackman who played Wolverine.In the year 2006, he played Richard White in the highly anticipated movie, Superman Returns (2006), which coincidentally was directed by Bryan Singer, who also directed previous X-Men installments. Although he appeared in Люди Iкс: Остання битва (2006), the third installment of the X-Men franchise, many would notice that he in fact had more screen time in \'Superman Returns\', as Lois Lane\'s long awaiting fiancé who had to accept the fact that his fiancée is in love with the man of steel. James earned great reviews from that movie, which led to him getting more movie roles. In 2007, James played Corny Collins in the film Hairspray (2007), an adaption of the Broadway musical based on John Waters movie, Hairspray (1988). He joined a star-studded cast, starring alongside top names such as John Travolta, Queen Latifah and Michelle Pfeiffer. James not only acted in that movie, but also sang two of the film\'s songs, \"The Nicest Kids In Town\", and \"Hairspray\". Being part of Hairspray catapulted James to a different level of stardom as audiences got to see another side of him. His next role was in the Disney movie, Зачарована (2007), playing Prince Edward, where he acted alongside Amy Adams, Susan Sarandon and Patrick Dempsey. Once again, James had the opportunity to sing in two songs from the movie, \"True Love\'s Kiss\" and \"That\'s Amore\". Зачарована (2007) appealed to not only older audiences but also to those who were fans of Disney\'s network productions. Following his huge success in the years 2006 and 2007, James played the male lead role in the romantic comedy, 27 весiль (2008), opposite actress Katherine Heigl in 2008. The movie did well at the box office, earning a gross revenue of over $159 million, which exceeded the expectations of crew members especially since it was under a $30 million budget.Marsden played the male lead in the horror film, Посилка (2009), based on the 1970 short story \"Button, Button\" by author Richard Matheson. He starred opposite Cameron Diaz in the movie.He co-starred in Accidental Love (2015) (previously Accidental Love (2015), a politically-themed romantic comedy, directed by David O. Russell and filmed in Columbia, South Carolina. Marsden\'s recent film roles include the sequel comedy Телеведучий 2 (2013), the romantic drama Найкраще в менi (2014), and the comedy Unfinished Business (2015).James was married to Lisa Linde, an actress known from her role in Days of Our Lives (1965). Lisa is the daughter of legendary country music songwriter Dennis Linde. The couple wed on July 22, 2000 and have a son, Jack Holden Marsden who was born on February 1, 2001, and a daughter, Mary James, who was born on August 10, 2005. They divorced in 2011. James has another son, born in 2012, with model Rose Costa.Many would assume that with all this success achieved by James at this age, he would be somewhat high-headed but James mentioned that despite all the attention he\'s getting from the public eye, he tries to keep himself as grounded as possible. He even admits that he flies coach instead of first class while traveling with his family. In an interview he mentioned that he believes he has a certain responsibility to let his children know that he isn\'t special because of what he does, but who he is as a person. With a great humble attitude and a bright future ahead of him, there\'s definitely more to expect from this Oklahoma native.'),(974,'Maura Tierney','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY2ODY2NTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg5MDQ0NTE@._V1_UY317_CR4,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1965-02-03','On the viewing horizon since the late 1980s, actress Maura Tierney has been a steady product of independent features, some hits and some misses, for close to a decade and a half. An odd and compelling beauty, she came from an upscale Bostonian family and was raised in the Hyde Park district.Born February 3, 1965, the eldest child of three of Pat, a real estate agent, and Joseph M. Tierney, a prosperous politician and city councilman, Maura initially studied at New York University. She left school prior to graduation when she hooked up with the Circle-in-the-Square theater school. Following some stage plays including \"Baby with the Bathwater\" and \"Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,\" she moved to the West Coast in the late 1980s finding minor roles here and there in TV-movies and making the rounds on episodic shows such as Growing Pains (1985), Family Ties (1982) and Law & Order (1990). She met actor/husband Billy Morrissette after both were fired from the set of an eventually-scrapped Ralph Macchio series. After a few other failed pilots and a short-lived TV series, Maura made a minor film debut with The Linguini Incident (1991) and progressed to leading lady status in the B-movie spoof Dead Women in Lingerie (1991), which didn\'t go over well. She finally hit paydirt on TV when she won a female co-lead as smart but insecure newswriter Lisa Miller on the comedy series NewsRadio (1995). The show sailed along for a number of seasons due to the fine comedy instincts of Dave Foley, Andy Dick and the late Saturday Night Live (1975) player Phil Hartman. The show lost its oomph, however, as well as its audience after Hartman\'s tragic 1998 shotgun slaying, despite an assured replacement in fellow Saturday Night Live (1975) alumni Jon Lovitz. The show couldn\'t escape its bad aura, and it was gone the following year.Maura\'s work on the TV sitcom thrust her into the film comedy limelight with prominent roles in such films as the Jim Carrey vehicle Брехун, брехун (1997). She also showed up as sly, darker-edged femmes in the thriller Первiсний страх (1996), Primary Colors (1998) and Instinct (1999).

Upon completing the script, Leigh and James had wanted to select an excerpt from their script, later to be known as Пила: Iгри на виживання (2004), and film it to pitch their film to studios. With the help of Charlie Clouser, who had composed the score for the film, and a few stand-in actors, Leigh and James shot the film with relatively no budget. Leigh had decided to star in the film as well.After the release of the full-length Пила: Iгри на виживання (2004), the film was met with overwhelming success in the box office both domestically and internationally. The film ended up grossing 55 million dollars in America, and 48 million dollars in other countries, totaling over $103 million worldwide. This was over 100 million dollars profit, over 80 times the production budget. This green-lit the sequel Пила 2 (2005), and later the rest of the Saw franchise based on the yearly success of the previous installment. Since its inception, Пила: Iгри на виживання (2004) has become the highest grossing horror franchise of all time worldwide in unadjusted dollars.

Typically setting each of his movies during one 24-hour period, Linklater\'s work explored what he dubbed \"the youth rebellion continuum,\" focusing in fine detail on generational rites and mores with rare compassion and understanding while definitively capturing the 20-something culture of his era through a series of nuanced, illuminating ensemble pieces which introduced any number of talented young actors into the Hollywood firmament. Born in Houston, Texas, Linklater suspended his educational career at Sam Houston State University in 1982, to work on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.

Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (née Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John\'s siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago\'s Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Клас (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall\'s geek brigade in Sixteen Candles (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like The Sure Thing (1985) and Краще вже померти... (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Скажи хоч щось (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in Кидали (1990).The next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins\' Actors\' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack\'s high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime\'s first feature was the sharply written comedy Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film\'s financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack\'s next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, \"the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals\") in Повiтряна в\'язниця (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood\'s Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case.Cusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Бути Джоном Малковiчем (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in High Fidelity (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby\'s popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his \"Top 5\" breakups to find out why he\'s so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He\'s also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn\'t reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a \"great piece of art\".'),(984,'Todd Phillips','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGY5MWRjM2MtNDkzNC00MDcwLWE2ZjYtOWNlZmM3MWIyNGZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAxMjM5NTA4._V1_UY317_CR131,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1970-12-20','Todd Phillips was born on December 20, 1970 in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA as Todd Bunzl.

Javier\'s early film role as a sexy stud in the black comedy, Jamón Jamón (1992) (aka Ham Ham) propelled him to instant popularity and threatened to typecast him as nothing more than a brawny sex symbol. Determined to avert a beefcake image, he refused similar subsequent roles and has gone on to win acclaim for his ability to appear almost unrecognizable from film to film. With over 25 movies and numerous awards under his belt, it is Javier\'s stirring, passionate performance as the persecuted Cuban writer, Reynaldo Arenas, in Before Night Falls (2000) that will long be remembered as his breakthrough role.

He was the son of Emma Jane (Whelan; 1863 - 1942) and East End greengrocer William Hitchcock (1862 - 1914). His parents were both of half English and half Irish ancestry. He had two older siblings, William Hitchcock (born 1890) and Eileen Hitchcock (born 1892). Raised as a strict Catholic and attending Saint Ignatius College, a school run by Jesuits, Hitch had very much of a regular upbringing. His first job outside of the family business was in 1915 as an estimator for the Henley Telegraph and Cable Company. His interest in movies began at around this time, frequently visiting the cinema and reading US trade journals.It was around 1920 when Hitchcock joined the film industry. He started off drawing the sets (he was a very skilled artist). It was there that he met Alma Reville, though they never really spoke to each other. It was only after the director for Always Tell Your Wife (1923) fell ill and Hitchcock was named director to complete the film that he and Reville began to collaborate. Hitchcock had his first real crack at directing a film, start to finish, in 1923 when he was hired to direct the film Number 13 (1922), though the production wasn\'t completed due to the studio\'s closure (he later remade it as a sound film). Hitchcock didn\'t give up then. He directed The Pleasure Garden (1925), a British/German production, which was very popular. Hitchcock made his first trademark film in 1927, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927) . In the same year, on the 2nd of December, Hitchcock married Alma Reville. They had one child, Patricia Hitchcock who was born on July 7th, 1928. His success followed when he made a number of films in Britain such as Ледi зникаe (1938) and Jamaica Inn (1939), some of which also gained him fame in the USA.In 1940, the Hitchcock family moved to Hollywood, where the producer David O. Selznick had hired him to direct an adaptation of \'Daphne du Maurier\'\'s Ребекка (1940). After Saboteur (1942), as his fame as a director grew, film companies began to refer to his films as \'Alfred Hitchcock\'s\', for example Alfred Hitcock\'s Психо (1960), Alfred Hitchcock\'s Family Plot (1976), Alfred Hitchcock\'s Frenzy (1972).Hitchcock was a master of pure cinema who almost never failed to reconcile aesthetics with the demands of the box-office.During the making of Frenzy (1972), Hitchcock\'s wife Alma suffered a paralyzing stroke which made her unable to walk very well. On March 7, 1979, Hitchcock was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award, where he said: \"I beg permission to mention by name only four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation, and encouragement, and constant collaboration. The first of the four is a film editor, the second is a scriptwriter, the third is the mother of my daughter Pat, and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen and their names are Alma Reville.\" By this time, he was ill with angina and his kidneys had already started to fail. He had started to write a screenplay with Ernest Lehman called The Short Night but he fired Lehman and hired young writer David Freeman to rewrite the script. Due to Hitchcock\'s failing health the film was never made, but Freeman published the script after Hitchcock\'s death. In late 1979, Hitchcock was knighted, making him Sir Alfred Hitchcock. On the 29th April 1980, 9:17AM, he died peacefully in his sleep due to renal failure. His funeral was held in the Church of Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Father Thomas Sullivan led the service with over 600 people attended the service, among them were Mel Brooks (director of High Anxiety (1977), a comedy tribute to Hitchcock and his films), Louis Jourdan, Karl Malden, Tippi Hedren, Janet Leigh and François Truffaut.'),(996,'Kristy Swanson','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2ExMGM3OWUtMTkzMi00OWQwLWFmNWItOTllMzM0MjRjYjllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkzMDczNzA@._V1_UY317_CR152,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1969-12-19','Kristy Swanson was born on December 19, 1969 in Mission Viejo, California, USA as Kristen Noel Swanson.

He is the son of Georgann (Gaither) and Thomas Henry Crudup III, and the grandson of prominent attorney William Cotter \"Billy\" Gaither, Jr.Crudup was raised in Florida and Texas. His family frequently moved and always being the new kid meant Billy had to develop some way of gaining acceptance. Being the class clown was his ticket in. He found roles in school pageants and developed funny impersonations to entertain family and friends. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina (where he confirmed his interest in acting). Upon graduation, Crudup headed to NYC to live with his brother Tommy (who was at that time a publicist) and study at New York University, where he joined a theatre troupe called \"the lab!\" and did little plays and musicals - he even played \"Schroeder\" in the famed children\'s musical \"You\'re A Good Man Charlie Brown!\".He then went on to earn a Master of Fine Arts from the Tisch School of the Arts at NY in 1994. A year later, he\'d already made a name for himself on Broadway, earning the Outer Critics Circle Outstanding Newcomer Award for his performance in Tom Stoppard\'s \"Arcadia\".Crudup\'s first big-screen acting gig was in the indie film Grind (1997), which was shot in 1994, but ended up on the shelf for three years. In 1996, he landed another, more lucrative role, opposite Hollywood hotshots Brad Pitt and Jason Patric in the Barry Levinson drama, Сплячi (1996). He followed that up with a brief appearance in Woody Allen\'s Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and a higher-profile turn as the rakish older brother in Inventing the Abbotts (1997).A self-described student of human nature, Crudup has said that he looks for characters wrestling with their mistakes. Rumor has it that he declined an audition for the lead in Титанiк (1997) in order to seek out more challenging projects--like the \"Steve Prefontaine\" biopic Without Limits (1998). \"Limits\" showcased Crudup\'s ability to completely transform himself for a role (a quality that would help him skirt stardom while continuing to land substantive parts). In 2000, with three major films in release, Crudup\'s already bustling movie career reached a fever pitch. He first hit the festival circuit in Keith Gordon\'s Waking the Dead (2000), the tale of an up-and-coming politician who is haunted by the death of his young wife. Next came the art-house favorite Jesus\' Son (1999). Finally, he starred as the semi-fictional \'70s rocker \"Russell Hammond\" in Cameron Crowe\'s much-lauded Майже знаменитi (2000). In 2002, his production of \"The Elephant Man\" on Broadway closed after 65 performances, due to low ticket sales.Crudup lives in New York and returns regularly to the stage - in fact, it was during the 1996 Broadway run of \"Bus Stop\" that he began his romance with longtime girlfriend, Mary-Louise Parker. That romance ended in 2004, when Crudup left the then-pregnant Parker for his Stage Beauty (2004) co-star, Claire Danes. He seems to prefer quiet anonymity to the pomp and circumstance of the movie star lifestyle, but his ever-growing popularity guarantees that he won\'t be able to avoid the spotlight altogether.'),(999,'Ben Unwin','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5ODMxNDI2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg0NDEzMQ@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg','1977-08-15','Ben started his career at the age of 12, playing a lead in the Musical \"Seven Little Australians\" for a year run at the Footbridge Theatre.
